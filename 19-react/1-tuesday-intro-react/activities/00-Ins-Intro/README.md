# Web Performance Perception

A study by Strangeloop, a web acceleration company that performed various surveys, which Tableau is using to inform our product decisions found the following:

- 78% of users felt stress or anger when using a slow website

- 47% of users expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less

- A 1 second delay results in a 16% decrease in satisfaction

- A single bad experience caused about half o f users to express a less positive perception of the company overall

- user behavior changed with delays as small as 100ms (time to blink your eyes)

  - likely a subconscious reaction

  - issued fewer queries, less likely to click links and waited longer to engage with the page

  - after improving performance Google found it took some users six weeks to return to their baseline behavior (this means if your site performs poorly within six weeks you get suboptimal behavior and perception)

- iconic (visual) memory lasts about 100ms, the same as above

  - when clicking a button our brain expects to see the button change to its pressed state in our iconic memory (100ms)

  - short term meory lasts 10-15s

- strangeloop found that users have to concentrate up to 50% harder when using a slow site

| Time Spent | Interaction Class | Notes                                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 100ms    | Instantaneous     | Software objects that mimic physical objects (ex. Buttons)     |
| < 1s       | Immediate         | Signal or acknowledgement that a command has been received     |
| 2-5s       | Flow              | Does not break user's concentration                            |
| 7-10s      | Captive           | User is likely to switch to something else and come back later |
