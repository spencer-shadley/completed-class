# Pre-class Drill

Write the below four functions, each of which has two parameters - an array and a function which returns a boolean given an entry in the array

## HasSome

Returns true if any of the values in the array meet the given condition

## HasNone

Returns true if none of the values in the array meet the given condition

## HasAll

Returns true if all of the values in the array meet the given condition

## HasMost

Returns true if more than 50% of the values in the array meet the given condition

## Hint

- The longest implementation of the above functions in my solution is five lines of code and the shortest is one line of code

- I did not use any existing array instance functions
