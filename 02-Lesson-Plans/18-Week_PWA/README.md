# Unit 18: PWA

## Overview

In this unit we will cover measuring and optimizing the performance of web applications. We will cover PWAs, service workers, analyzing performance, and webpack.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/18-PWA/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* We will be making use of students Project 2 during the first half of 18.1. Ensure all students have a deployed project to work with.

* When working with PWAs, you may need to clear your storage periodically in order to see each iteration of activities. Do so in DevTools under `Application > Clear storage > Clear site data`.

* Webpack can be a difficult tool to get your head around, so be as clear as possible in your explanations and be ready to answer plenty of student questions. It is recommended that you review the webpack [docs](https://webpack.js.org/concepts). You may want to read [Why Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/why-webpack) so that you are prepared to answer student questions like "Why are we learning this?".

## Heads Up

Next unit we will start React, with the following unit covering state management in React using cutting-edge techniques. Ensure that you are up to date with the latest best practices, including the use of Hooks, the Context API, and a general understanding of how redux works.
