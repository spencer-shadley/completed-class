# Unit 13: MVC

## Overview

In this unit, students will be diving into the basics of Handlebars, Object-Relational Mapping, and full stack applications.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/13-MVC/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* Handlebars can seem daunting at first, but it is ultimately a very powerful templating tool which your students might find useful. Try to keep to a pace that your students seem comfortable learning, so as to make sure no one is left behind.

* There are A LOT of topics that we will be covering over the course of this unit's lesson plans, but it is especially important for your students to understand how ORMs function. Make sure to take your time when covering this topic since it is crucial for the homework.

## Heads Up

Next unit we will be spending some more time working with full stack applications, so it's okay if the syntax of client to server communication hasn't quite sunk in yet.
