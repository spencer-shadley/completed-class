### 1. Instructor Do: Arrow Function Demo (10 mins)

* In this demonstration you will give students and overview of arrow functions, including syntax differences, when to use them, and when to avoid them.

* Explain to the class that ES6 introduces a newer shorter syntax for writing functions. Consider the following example found in [01-syntax.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/16-Ins_ArrowFunction/01-syntax.js).

* Walk the students through each function below. See if they can point out the differences in syntax.

  ```js
  // ES5 function
  var createGreeting = function(message, name) {
    return message + ", " + name + "!";
  };

  // ES6 arrow function
  var createGreeting = (message, name) => {
    return message + ", " + name + "!";
  };

  // ES6 arrow function with one expression
  var createGreeting = (message, name) => message + ", " + name + "!";

  // ES6 arrow function with one parameter
  var greet = greeting => console.log(greeting);

  // Calling an arrow function
  var greeting = createGreeting("Hello", "Angie");

  // Logs "Hello, Angie!";
  greet(greeting);
  ```

* Take a few moments to answer any questions about the arrow function syntax before moving on to some behavioral differences between arrow functions and regular functions.

* Now walk through the first part of the code in [02-context.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/16-Ins_ArrowFunction/02-context.js).

  ```js
  // Depending on the environment `setTimeout` is called in, it may refer to one of two objects
  // In the browser, `setTimeout` is a property of the `window` object
  // In node, it belongs to a special "Timeout" object

  var person = {
    name: "Hodor",
    saySomething: function() {
      console.log(this.name + " is thinking...");
      setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(this.name + "!");
      }, 100);
    }
  };

  person.saySomething(); // prints "Hodor is thinking..."
  // prints "undefined!" 100ms later

  // Arrow functions bind the `this` keyword to the object it's created inside of
  // i.e. whatever `this` is where it's created
  var person = {
    name: "Hodor",
    saySomething: function() {
      console.log(this.name + " is thinking...");
      setTimeout(() => console.log(this.name + "!"), 100);
    }
  };

  person.saySomething(); // "Prints Hodor is thinking..."
  // prints `Hodor!` 100ms later
  ```

  * Students may still not feel completely comfortable with the `this` keyword in JavaScript yet, inform them that many experienced developers still aren't as it's a tricky topic.

  * When run in the browser `this` inside of the `setTimeout` method refers to the `window`, when run inside of node, it refers to a newly created `Timeout` object. In both cases, `setTimeout` changes `this` to no longer be the `person` object.

  * Explain that we could resolve this issue by using `.bind(this)` as we've done before, but ES6 introduces arrow functions, a shorter more concise syntax for doing just this.

  * Point out how this code works as intended. Explain that this is because an arrow function automatically binds to the context or object it's created inside of, even if it is not a direct property of that object. The arrow function is created when `saySomething` is run, inside of `person` right before the `setTimeout` is run.

* Explain that this may seem great, but we can experience unexpected results if we were to write an object's method as an arrow function. 

* Demonstrate [03-arrow-property-methods.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/16-Ins_ArrowFunction/03-property-methods.js).

  ```js
  // Avoid using arrow functions for object methods
  var dog = {
    name: "Lassie",
    sound: "Woof!",
    makeSound: () => console.log(this.sound),
    readTag: () => console.log("The dog's tag reads: " + this.name + ".")
  };

  // Prints `undefined`
  dog.makeSound();

  // Prints `The dog's tag reads: undefined.`
  dog.readTag();

  // In the makeSound and readTag methods, `this` doesn't refer to `dog`
  // If this code run in node, `this` refers to `module.exports` (the object containing all the exports in this file)
  // If this code was run in the browser, `this` would refer to the window
  ```

  * Explain that when working with objects, we typically want to avoid using arrow functions for its methods. In these cases, the arrow function will bind to the context it's created inside of (probably the `window` or `module.exports` object).

  * We can replace regular functions with arrow functions _most_ of the time, but they aren't meant to replace regular functions altogether for reasons like this. Additionally (native, non-transpiled) arrow functions can't be used as constructor functions and also don't have access to Function prototype methods such as `bind`, `call`, and `apply`.

  * Students will become more comfortable with when to use and not use arrow functions as they practice using them. For now, they should understand that they can use them most of the time, but they should avoid using them as object methods.

* At a minimum, arrow functions give us slightly shorter syntax for writing functions.

* Take a moment to answer any lingering questions.

### 2. Student Do: Arrow Function Practice (10 mins)

* In this activity students will convert a file with pre-written code over to use arrow functions where suitable.

* Students won't need to fully understand how all the code in this activity works, just the rules we've established about when arrow functions should and shouldn't be used.

* **File:** [Arrow Function Practice](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/17-Stu_ArrowFunctionPractice/Unsolved/index.js)

* **Instructions**: 

  * Open [Unsolved/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/17-Stu_ArrowFunctionPractice/Unsolved/index.js) in your editor and run the code. Take a few moments to study the values logged to the console, but don't worry about understanding every part of the code. For this activity you only need to remember the rules established about when arrow functions should and shouldn't be used.

  * Update this example to use arrow functions **where suitable**. If successful, the code should still work the exact same way.

  * Remember the case from the last example in which we should _not_ be using arrow functions.

  * **Bonus**

  * After you've converted all of the functions to arrow functions where possible, look for opportunities to shorten the arrow function syntax even further by removing parentheses and curly braces where allowed.

  * Instructional staff should be circulating the room checking in on students progress and making themselves available for assistance.

### 3. Instructor Do: Review Arrow Function Practice (5 mins)

* Open [Arrow Function Practice](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/17-Stu_ArrowFunctionPractice/Solved/index.js) in your editor and run the code. 

* Point out that even though we've converted a few of the examples over to use arrow functions, the code works exactly the same as it did before.

  ```js
  var funnyCase = string => {
    var newString = "";
    for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
      if (i % 2 === 0) newString += string[i].toLowerCase();
      else newString += string[i].toUpperCase();
    }
    return newString;
  };
  ```

* Point out again how we can omit the parentheses around the arrow function parameters if there is only one. This **does not** work if the arrow function has multiple or no parameters. This is optional, assure students that they don't need to do this, but may see code written this way.

  ```js
  var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

  var doubled = map(numbers, element => element * 2);
  ```
  * Point out again how we can also omit an arrow function's curly braces if the arrow function body only contains one expression. The single expression is automatically returned from the function when we use this shorter syntax. Students may see code written in this way, but this is also optional, if students prefer, they may continue to use curly braces and the `return` keyword.

* Finally point out the `netflixQueue` object. Ask the class: Why didn't we convert the functions here to arrow functions?

  ```js
  var netflixQueue = {
    queue: [
      "Mr. Nobody",
      "The Matrix",
      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind",
      "Fight Club"
    ],
    watchMovie: function() {
      this.queue.pop();
    },
    addMovie: function(movie) {
      this.queue.unshift(movie);
    },
    printQueue: function() {
      var list = "";
      for (var i = this.queue.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        var currentMovie = this.queue[i];
        list += (this.queue.length - i) + ". " + currentMovie + "\n";
      }
      console.log(list);
    }
  };
  ```
  * Whenever we're working with objects, we usually don't want to write its methods as arrow functions since `this` inside of the arrow function will refer to whatever object the one we're defining is inside of (usually the `window` in the browser or `module.exports` in node).

* Inform the class that the key takeaways for now are:

  * In most cases, we can replace regular functions with arrow functions.

  * Arrow functions shouldn’t be object methods.

### 4. Instructor Do: Let and Block Scope (10 mins)

* In this example we will demonstrate the new `let` keyword and how block scoping works.

* Explain to the class that by now they should be familiar with function scope. Have a volunteer offer up their explanation for what this means.

* With function scope, variables defined inside of a function body are only available inside of that function, as well as functions defined inside of that function.

* Explain that ES6 offers us a new way to define variables using `let`. Unlike `var`, `let` is block scoped.

* Inform the class that a "block" is created whenever we have a pair of curly braces. This includes loops and conditional statements as well as function bodies. Since `let` is block scoped, any variables we define using `let` inside of a block are only available inside of that block.

* This can help us avoid a few silly mistakes in our code. 

* Point out the first example in [Let Block Scope](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/18-Ins_LetAndBlockScope/index.js).

  ```js
  // 1. When using var, our counter exists after a for-loop is done

  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }

  console.log(i); // Prints 5


  // When using let, our counter is not defined outside of the for-loop block

  let x = 42;

  for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
    console.log(j);
    console.log(x);
  }

  console.log(j); // ReferenceError: j is not defined

  let j = 42;
  console.log(j); // prints 42
  ```

  * Point out how our for-loop counter continues to exist after the for-loop has ended. We don’t need it anymore. This could potentially cause issues if we wanted to refer to a different variable with the same name as the counter later.

  * Even though the `let` declaration is not technically inside of the curly braces, it's considered to be part of the block anyway in this case.

  * Point out how the counter no longer exists after the loop is done when we use `let`.

  ```js
  // 4. When writing conditionals, values defined inside the conditional block exist outside of it

  if (true) {
    var favoriteColor = "red";
  }

  console.log(favoriteColor); // Prints `red`

  // When using let, values defined inside of a conditional block don't exist outside

  let favoriteFood;

  if (true) {
    favoriteFood = "pizza";
  }

  // This works since favoriteColor is not defined inside of a block
  console.log(favoriteFood);
  // Prints `pizza`

  ```

* Point out how when using `let`, any values defined inside of a conditional block no longer exist outside of the conditional.

* If you need to use a variable both inside and outside of  a block, you’d define it outside of the block. Example:

  ```js
  let favoriteFood;

  if (true) {
    favoriteFood = "pizza";
  }

  // This works since favoriteFood is not defined inside of a block
  console.log(favoriteFood);
  // Prints `pizza`
  ```

* This helps express intent because it tells others more information about where or how we’ll be using the value.

* Inform the class that going forward, we will no longer be using `var`. 

* Unlike arrow functions and regular functions, we can completely replace `var` with `let`.

* Take a moment to answer any questions, but avoid getting too off track! We'll go over `const` next!

### 5. Instructor Do: Constant Reference (10 mins)

* In this demonstration we will cover the new `const` keyword for defining variables and when it should be used.

* Explain to the class that while we can replace all the `var`s in all of our code with `let`, we also have one more new option for declaring variables: `const`.

* Ask the class: Can anyone tell me what they think `const` is used for in JavaScript?

  * Odds are, if any students have been exposed to another programming language, someone will answer that `const` is like `let`, except that it's for variables which can't be changed. This is _mostly_ true.

* Explain that `const` has the same rules as `let` for block scoping. There is, however, one one key difference between `const` and `let`: a variable declared with `const` cannot be _reassigned_.

* Inform the class that using `const` can help prevent us from accidentally reassigning values we don't mean to, and also helps express intent, helping us document important values in our code for other developers, or for our future selves when we forget how the code works.

* Open [Constant Reference](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/19-Ins_ConstantReference/index.js) and go through each example.

  ```js
  // const can be used for values which we will not reassign

  const age = 25;

  age++; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

  // ==========================================================================

  // const name = "";


  // name = "Cherie"; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
  ```

* Point out that whenever we try to reassign a variable declared with `const`, we get an error in the console. 
  
* Whenever we're working with primitive types such as strings or numbers, even modifying the value e.g. `age++`, is considered to be reassigning it. 

* This is because primitive types such as numbers and strings are "passed by value", i.e. a new value is created and referred to in memory anytime we modify variable containing a primitive type.

  ```js
  // const doesn't mean `constant value`, instead means `constant reference`

  // Unlike primitive data types, objects and arrays are passed by reference, rather than passed by value
  const beatles = ["John", "Paul", "Ringo"];
  beatles.push("George");

  // This works because by updating an array's contents, we aren't changing the reference to the underlying array
  console.log(beatles); // Prints `["John", "Paul", "Ringo", "George"]`

  console.log(beatles);

  const person = { name: "Brianna", age: 11 };
  person.age++;
  person.favoriteMovie = "Spider-Man";
  person.name = "Carla";

  // console.log(person); // Prints `{ name: 'Carla', age: 12, favoriteMovie: 'Spider-Man' }`
  ```

* Point out how in the second example, we can update the array and object as long as we aren't reassigning them completely, i.e. using the `=` operator to assign the variables a new values.

* Explain that `const` in JavaScript doesn't mean "constant value", but rather "constant reference". Because arrays and objects are non-primitive values, they are "passed by reference", i.e. modifying an array or object doesn't create a new object or array in memory. This is why we can push to the array or update the object's properties.

  ```js
  // While we can MODIFY arrays and objects that are using `const`, we can't reassign them

  const item = {
    id: 23,
    title: "Underwater Basket-Weaving DVD",
    price: "$17.99"
  };

  item.price = "$1.99";

  console.log(item);

  const item = {
    id: 11,
    title: "Underwater Basket-Weaving Shoes",
    price: "$101.43"
  }; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

  const ninjaTurtles = [];

  // The same rules apply to arrays, we can MODIFY them, but not completely reassign them

  ninjaTurtles = [
    "Michaelangelo",
    "Leonardo",
    "Raphael",
    "Donatello"
  ]; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
  ```
  * To check for understanding, ask the class: `Why isn't this last example allowed?`

    * While we can modify arrays and objects declared with `const`, we still can't reassign them completely.

* Key takeaways for this demonstration:

  * Both `const` and `let` are block scoped.

  * Use `let` whenever a value will need to be reassigned.

  * Use `const` whenever a value won't need to be reassigned.

### 6. Student Do: Convert Const Let Arrow (10 mins)

* In this activity students will convert a prebuilt Crystal Guessing Game to use the new ES6 syntax covered so far.

* Stress that students don't need to completely understand all of the code in the activity. They just need to remember what we just overed about `const`, `let`, and arrow functions.

* **File:** [Convert Const Let Arrow](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/20-Stu_ConvertConstLetArrow/Unsolved/index.html)

* **Instructions**: 

  * Open [Unsolved/index.html](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/20-Stu_ConvertConstLetArrow/Unsolved/index.html) in your web browser and take a moment to understand the application's functionality.

  * Now open [Unsolved/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/20-Stu_ConvertConstLetArrow/Unsolved/index.js) in your code editor and convert the existing code over to use the ES6 syntax we've learned about in the previous examples.

  * Make sure to do the following:

    1. Convert all `var` identifiers to use `const` or `let` &mdash; whichever is more appropriate.

    2. Convert functions to arrow functions **where suitable** &mdash; remember, arrow functions are not right for every situation.

  **IMPORTANT**: After each change, run the the code in your web browser to make sure that everything still works as expected. If completed successfully, there should be no difference in the way the app runs in the browser before and after the changes.

  * Remember to use `let` where values are expected to be reassigned, use `const` for when they are not.

  * Remember that arrow functions can't be used as constructor functions, and they are not suitable for object methods.

### 7. Instructor Do: Review Convert Const Let Arrow (5 mins)

* Open [Solved/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/20-Stu_ConvertConstLetArrow/Solved/index.js) in your code editor and walk through the code with the class.

* For every `let`, ask the class: "Why it isn't a `const` instead?"

  * Because the value is reassigned somewhere.

* For every `function` keyword: ask the class, "Why isn't an arrow function isn't used instead?"

  * In this activity, constructor functions and functions that are object methods using the `this` keyword are kept as regular functions.

  * For object methods, arrow functions will prevent `this` from binding to the object.

  * Arrow function's can't be used as constructor functions.

* Run the application in the browser and demonstrate that it works the same as it did before.

* Answer any remaining questions about the solution.


### 8. Instructor Do: Functional Loops (10 mins) 

* In this demonstration students will be introduced to new Array methods `forEach`, `filter`, and `map`.

* Explain that `filter` and `map` are used heavily in React when rendering elements from array data. Students have probably seen `forEach` already, but it's a good stepping stone for understanding `filter` and `map`.

* Go through each example in [index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/21-Ins_FunctionalLoops/index.js) one at a time to demonstrate the utility of `forEach`, `filter`, and `map`.

```js
const moviePatrons = [
  { name: "Tom", age: 16 },
  { name: "Ashley", age: 31 },
  { name: "Sarah", age: 18 },
  { name: "Alvin", age: 22 },
  { name: "Cherie", age: 14 },
  { name: "Malcolm", age: 15 }
];

moviePatrons.forEach(patron => console.log(patron.age));

const canWatchRatedR = moviePatrons.filter(function(patron) {
  return patron.age > 17;
});

console.log(canWatchRatedR);

const cardedMoviePatrons = moviePatrons.map(patron => {
  if (patron.age >= 17) {
    patron.canWatchRatedR = true;
  } else {
    patron.canWatchRatedR = false;
  }
  return patron;
});

console.log("Carded Movie Patrons: ");
console.log(cardedMoviePatrons);
```

  * Explain how each of the array methods:

    * Works on an array

    * Runs a callback function once for each element in the array

    * Passes the each element into the callback as an argument

  * Then work on explaining the differences between each of these methods:

    * `forEach` is the simplest. It runs the callback for each element in the array

    * `fitler` is similar to `forEach`, but it returns a brand new array using elements in the original array. If an element's callback function returns a truthy value, it is added to the newly returned array, otherwise it is _filtered_ out and doesn't get added to the new array.

    * `map` is similar in that it also returns a brand new array using elements in the original array. Unlike `filter`, the new array created with `map` is always the same length as the original array. Whatever is returned by the callback on each iteration is what goes into the new array. We can use this to create a new array of modified elements, or elements computed from values in the original array.

* Run each example one at a time and demonstrate the logged output for students.

* If helpful, demonstrate how each piece of functionality can be achieved (with more code) using for-loops.

### 9. Student Do: Functional Loops (10 mins) 

* In this activity students will use the `map` and `filter` methods to solve problems they previously would have used for-loops for.

* Consider live-coding each problem piece by piece over the duration of the activity.

* **Files**: [Functional Loops Unsolved](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/22-Stu_FunctionalLoops/Unsolved)

* **Instructions**

  * Open [Functional Loops Unsolved](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/22-Stu_FunctionalLoops/Unsolved) and examine the `map.js` and `filter.js` files. 

  * Study the examples provided and complete the problems outlined in the comments.

### Bonus

* Use arrow functions as callbacks here.

### 10. Instructor Do: Review Functional Loops (5 mins)

* Once time's up, open the [activity solution](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-Nod01-Activities/22-Stu_FunctionalLoops/Solved) and go over the code.

* Start by demonstrating the `map` example.

  ```js
  const originalArray = [1, 3, 2, 5, 10];

  const doubledArray = originalArray.map(function(data) {
    return data * 2;
  });

  console.log(doubledArray);
  console.log(originalArray);

  const tripledArray = originalArray.map(data => data * 3);
  const oddOrEven = originalArray.map(num => (num % 2 === 0 ? "even" : "odd"));
  ```

  * Remind the class that the callback is run once for each element in the array. Whatever it returns is what goes into the corresponding index of the new array.

  * If the arrow function syntax is still confusing, refactor the solutions to use regular functions instead.

* Then move on to the `filter` example.

  ```js
  const originalArray = [1, 3, 2, 5, 10];

  const evenNumbers = originalArray.filter(function(data) {
    if (data % 2 === 0) {
      return true;
    }
  });

  console.log(evenNumbers);
  console.log(originalArray);

  const isPrime = num => {
    for (let i = 2; i < num; i++) {
      if (num % i === 0) return false;
    }
    return num !== 1;
  };


  numbers (`primeArray`)
  const primeArray = originalArray.filter(isPrime);

  larger than 5(`moreThan5Array`)

  const moreThan5Array = originalArray.filter(num => num > 5);
  ```

  * Point out that we don't need to pass an anonymous function into the `map` and `filter` methods &mdash; we can write a named function and use that instead, as is the case for `isPrime`.

  * Remind the class that if the function returns something truthy, that array element is copied to the new array, otherwise it is skipped.

    * The first example should contain an array of only prime numbers, the second should only contain numbers larger than `5`.

  * Once again, refactor the solution to regular functions if arrow functions are still a point of confusion.

* Check for understanding by asking questions such as:

  * "When's a time in real life when you need to _filter_ through something?"

    * When looking for a word in the dictionary, you're _filtering_ out all the words that don't contain the same letters as the one you're looking for.

    * When shopping for pants, you're _filtering_ out all the ones on the rack that aren't your size.

    * When you're looking for your friend in a crowd, you're _filtering_ out everyone that doesn't look like them.

  * "When's a time in real life when you need to _map_ over something?"

    * When you're _mapping_ through your todolist and marking off all the things you've completed for the day.

    * When you're _mapping_ through your laundry pile, categorizing your clothes so you can put them into the correct drawers.

* Explain that just like how we need to map and filter over things in real life, we often need to in code as well.

* Take a moment to answer any remaining questions before the next demonstration.

### 11. BREAK (15 mins)

- - -

### 12. Instructor Do: Template Literals Demo (5 mins)

* Students will now be introducted to template literals, a new feature in ES6.

* Explain that a template literal is a special type of string that lets you create complex strings more easily and more efficiently. 

* Using template literals, you can create multi-line strings and use string interpolation.

* Demo the following code in [10-Ins_Template_Literals/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-Nod01-Activities/23-Ins_Template_Literals/index.js)

```js
const arya = {
  first: "Arya",
  last: "Stark",
  origin: "Winterfell",
  allegiance: "House Stark"
};

const greeting = `My name is ${arya.first}!
I am loyal to ${arya.allegiance}.`;

console.log(greeting); // prints
// My name is Arya!
// I am loyal to House Stark.
```

* Point out that template literals use backticks `(``)`, not quotes (' or "), to wrap the string.

* Also point out that we created a multiline string without using `\n`.

### 13. Student Do: Template Literals (10 mins)

* **File** [Unsolved/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/24-Stu_Template_Literals/Solved/index.js)

* **Instructions**

  * First create a music object following the comments in [Solved/index.js](Solved/index.js).

  * Then use template literal syntax to display your objects data. When you open `index.html` you should see the results if completed successfully.


### 14. Instructor Do: Review Template Literals (5 mins)

* Open [Solved/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/24-Stu_Template_Literals/Solved/index.js) and review the code.

* Let students know that they will get a lot more practice moving forward, the biggest takeaway is to know that you have this tool available to you.

### 15. Instructor Do: For...Of Demo (5 mins)

* Students will now be introduced to the For...Of syntax provided in ES6.

* There are many ways to iterate in JS but the real power of for...in is the flexibility it provides.

* Explain that the for...of statement creates a loop iterating over objects, including Array, Map, Set, String, TypedArray. 

* In comparison, the `forEach` method which students are familiar with only works with arrays.

* Walk students through some common use cases in your console.

```js
// Using arrays
const songs = ['Bad Guy', 'Old Town Road', '7 Rings'];

for (const value of songs) {
  console.log(value);
}

// Bad Guy
// Old Town Road
// 7 Rings
```

```js
// Using map
const songs = new Map([['Bad Guy', 1], ['Old Town Road', 2]]);

for (const [key, value] of songs) {
  console.log(`${key}'s chart position is ${value}`);
}

// Output:
// Bad Guy's chart position is 1
// Old Town Road's chart position is 2
```

* Explain that the for...in loop is very flexible and we will continue to learn about it's use cases as we progress through the course.

### 16. Student Do: For...Of (10 mins)

* **File:** [Unsolved/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/26-Stu_For_Of/Unsolved/index.js)

* **Instructions:**

  * Select all of the songs in `index.html` and store them in a variable using JavaScript.

  * Iterate through your collection with a for...of and:

  * Add a `class` that changes the color to red (you have to create this class in your CSS file)

### 17. Instructor Do: Review For...Of (5 mins)

* Review the previous activity. 

* If time permits, feel free to expand and show other use cases for `for...of`. 

* They syntax is relatively straightforward, the key takeaway is knowing when to use and and what to use it for.

### 18. Instructor Do: Rest and Spread Demo (5 mins)

* Students will now be introduced to the spread and rest syntax available in ES6.

* Open [12-Ins_Spread_and_Rest/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/27-Ins_Rest_and_Spread/index.js) and step through the code.

#### Rest Parameters

* Explain that the rest parameter collects all remaining elements into an array.

* Be sure to point out that a rest paramter has to be the last argument in an array.

```js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

console.log(add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) // => 3
```

* Ask the class why they think the `add` function returned 3?

* Explain that although it is possible to call a function with any number of arguments, only the fist two arguments will be counted.

* Let's rewrite this function using a rest operator.

```js
function add(...nums) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let num of nums) sum += num;
  return sum
}

add(1) // => 1
add(3,3) // => 6
add(1, 1, 4, 5) // => 11
```

* In this example, we use a rest operator to collect all of the arguments into a `nums` array, giving us the ability to pass in as many arguments as we want.

* Let's try another one.

```js
function howManyArgs(...args) {
  return `You passed ${args.length} arguments.`; // point out the template literal
}

console.log(howManyArgs(0, 1)); // You have passed 2 arguments.
console.log(howManyArgs("argument!", null, ["one", 2, "three"], 4)); // You have passed 4 arguments.
```
* The takeaway here is these variables are now available in an array inside our function, we can also pass in as many as we want.

#### Spread Operator

* The spread operator allows iterables such as arrays, objects and strings to be expanded into single arguments or elements.

* Run the following example for students.

```js
// Spread Operator

let dragons = ['Drogon', 'Viserion', 'Rhaegal'];
let weapons = ['dragonglass', ...dragons, 'wildfire']; // notice the spread operator ...dragons

console.log(weapons); // prints ["dragonglass", "Drogon", "Viserion", "Rhaegal", "wildfire"]

```

* Here you can see that we have expanded both arrays into a new array with all of the elements. 

* Explain that there are a lot of use cases for rest and spread and they will continue to get more practice with them as the progress in the course.

* Take any clarifying questions before moving on.

### 19. Student Do: Rest and Spread Syntax (10 mins)

* **File:** [Unsolved/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/28-Stu_Rest_and_Spread/Unsolved/index.js)

* **Instructions:**

  * Following the comments in `index.js`:

  * Copy the `songs` array into another array using spread and console.log what it returns.

  * Modify the `addition` function so that is uses the rest operator and maintains the same functionality. You should still be able to pass in any number of arguments. Run the code first in your console to see the functionality.


### 20. Instructor Do: Review Rest and Spread Syntax (5 mins)

* Open [Solved/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/28-Stu_Rest_and_Spread/Solved/index.js) and step through the code.

* This first part is relatively straightforeward, but check for understanding to see if there are any hangups for students.


```js
const songs = ["Creep", "Everlong", "Bulls On Parade", "Song 2", "What I Got"];
const new_songs = [...songs];

console.log(new_songs); // => ["Creep", "Everlong", "Bulls On Parade", "Song 2", "What I Got"];
```

* This one might have been a little tricky for students. There is a chance that they have not seen `reduce` before, so take a second to explain what it does. A

* Let students know that it's very common to be introduced to new methods, functions and concepts on the job and they should embrace the uncertainty of new material.


```js

// unsolved version
function addition(x, y, z) {
  const array = [x, y, z];
  return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
console.log(addition(1, 2, 3)); // 6

// solved using rest
function addition(...array) {
  return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); // you don't have to change this line of code but look up reduce if you're not sure what it does here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce
}
console.log(addition(1, 2, 3)); // 6
console.log(addition(1, 2, 3, 4, 100)); // 110
```

* There is a good chance that students will be confused on where spread and operators go, since they are very similar and can be used in similar situations. 

* Let them know that this is just an introduction and they will begin to pick up fluency as they get more practice.

* Take any remaining questions before moving on.

### 21. Instructor Do: Object Destructuring (10 mins)

* In this example, students will be introduced to the ES6 object destructuring syntax.

* Explain that object destructuring is a way for us to pull properties off of an object an onto separate variables for easier access. We can achieve this without ES6, but now we have a newer shorthand for doing so.

* Go through each example inside of [index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/29-Ins_ObjDestructuring/index.js).

  * Highlight how we can destructure multiple object properties at once, saving us a few lines of code.

  * Demonstrate how this is also possible with function parameters. This allows us to have named function parameters i.e. if we passed multiple values into a function one at a time, we'd need them to be passed in the specific order intended. Now we can simply expect an object and pull the properties off without worrying about the order they're passed in or write extra code to destructure them the old way.

  ```js
  const arya = {
  name: "Arya Stark",
  parents: ["Eddard Stark", "Catelyn Stark"]
  };

  const jaime = {
    name: "Jaime Lannister",
    parents: ["Tywin Lannister", "Joanna Lannister"]
  };

  // In the past, if we wanted to pull off an object's property we'd have to do something like this:

  const aryaName = arya.name;
  const aryaParents = arya.parents;

  console.log(aryaName); // prints `"Arya Stark"`
  console.log(aryaParents); // prints `["Eddard Stark", "Catelyn Stark"]`

  // Now with ES6 object destructuring syntax, we can do this:

  const { name, parents } = arya;

  console.log(name); // prints `"Jaime Lannister"`
  console.log(parents); // prints `["Tywin Lannister", "Joanna Lannister"]`

  // We can also rename our destructured properties like so:

  const { name: jaimeName } = jaime;
  console.log(jaimeName); // prints `"Jaime Lannister"`

  // We can also destructure parameters using the same feature. e.g. previously we might have done something like this:

  const logCharacter = character =>
    console.log(
      character.name +
        "'s parents are: " +
        character.parents[0] +
        " and " +
        character.parents[1] +
        "."
    );

  logCharacter(arya);

  // But now we can do this:

  const betterLogCharacter = ({ name, parents }) =>
    console.log(
      name + "'s parents are: " + parents[0] + " and " + parents[1] + "."
    );

  betterLogCharacter(jaime);
  ```

### 22. Student Do: Object Destructuring (10 mins)

* **File:** [Unsolved/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/30-Stu_ObjDestructuring/01-Activities/Unsolved/index.js)

* **Instructions:**

  * Following the comments in `index.js`, write code that successfully `console.log`'s the statements.

### 23. Instructor Do: Review Object Destructuring (5 mins)

* Open [Solved/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/30-Stu_ObjDestructuring/Solved/index.js) in your editor and walk students through the solved exercise.

```js
// 1. Object
const arya = {
  first: "Arya",
  last: "Stark",
  origin: "Winterfell",
  allegiance: "House Stark"
};

const { first, last, origin, allegiance } = arya;
console.log(first); // <= Arya
console.log(last); // <= Stark

// 2. Nested Object
const john = {
  first: "John",
  last: "Snow",
  title: "Prince",
  family: {
    brothers: {
      brother1: "Rob Stark",
      brother2: "Rickon Stark"
    },
    sisters: {
      sister1: "Arya Stark",
      sister2: "Sansa Stark"
    }
  }
};

const { brother1, brother2 } = john.family.brothers;
console.log(brother1); // <= Rob Stark
console.log(brother2); // <= Rickon Stark

// 3. Arrays
const characters = ["Ned Stark", "The Quiet Wolf", "House Stark"];

const [name, alias, allegiance] = characters;
console.log(name, alias, allegiance); // <= Ned Stark The Quiet Wolf House Stark

// 4. Strings
const skills = "The Usurper, male, Baratheon, Cersei"; // string of data

const [alias, gender, family, spouse] = skills.split(","); // set variables and split
console.log(alias, gender, family, spouse); // print them by variable name
```

* Check for understanding and take questions to clarify before closing for the day.
