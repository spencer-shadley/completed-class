# 07.2 Lesson Plan: Project 1 (6:30 PM)

## Overview

Students work in groups on their first project.

## Instructor Notes

* No classroom instruction today. 

* You will assume the role of 'scrum master' and hold standing meetings with each group. The purpose of these scrums is to: 

    1. Gauge progress on projects
    
    2. Course correct if scope creeps or focus shifts
    
    3. Most importantly, hold students accountable. Participation is a requirement for receipt of a passing grade. 
    
* To keep the standing meetings short, require that students physically stand up. Ask each student the following questions: 

    * What did you accomplish? 

    * What are your goals? 

    * Are there any obstacles? 

* Prioritize meeting with any groups that have not yet identified a project idea, drafted a user story, or created a wireframe. These are your at-risk groups.
