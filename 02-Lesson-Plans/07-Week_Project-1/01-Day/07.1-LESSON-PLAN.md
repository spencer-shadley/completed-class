# 07.1 Lesson Plan: Project Week(s) (6:30 PM)

## Overview

Today's class introduces Project 1 and Agile software development.

## Instructor Notes

* ‚ùó Determine project groups prior to class. Create groups of 3 or 4 students. Three is ideal, but not always possible. In groups of four (or more), it is easy for weaker students to be cut out of the workflow or hide behind their stronger teammates. **DO NOT allow students to work alone or in pairs.** Group projects are one of the few opportunities for students to work collaboratively. 

* If students complain about group configurations, remind them of the following:

  * In the real-world, you don't get to choose your co-workers

  * Working collaboratively is an important skill to acquire as a developer

* üìù Students will be allowed to form their own groups for the final project. 

* The first 50 minutes of class are lecture on agile software development. Students then break into groups to brainstorm ideas and prepare user stories and wireframes. Use the time after break to meet with each team to discuss their idea and course correct as you see fit. 

* ‚ùó Two in-class demonstrations ask you to use an existing GitHub repository. You can create one on-the-fly or you may want to create on in advance.


## Learning Objectives

* Explain agile software development 

* Explain minimum viable product (MVP) in relation to agile

* Create Issues on GitHub

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Agile (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the slide deck and follow these prompts with their corresponding slides:

  * **What is a project?**: We're about to begin our first project. But first, what is a project?

  * **Projects**: A project is "any undertaking, carried out individually or collaboratively and possibly involving research or design, that is carefully planned (usually by a project team) to achieve a particular aim." [Wikipedia: Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project)

  * **How do we carefully plan a project?**: 

  * **Project management**: the practice of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at the specified time. The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints. [Wikipedia: Project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management)

  * **What is the definition of agile?**: In general, what does it mean to be _agile_?

  * **agile [ aj-uhl, -ahyl ]**: According to dictionary.com, agile is "quick and well-coordinated in movement". 

  * **What is agile software development?**: What do we think "agile" means in terms of software development?

  * **Agile software development**: Agile software development is an iterative approach to developing software. Teams deliver value to their customers faster by working incrementally rather than working towards a big launch. Teams improve and respond to change by continuously evaluating project plans, requirements and user needs. 

  * **What is iterative development?**: What is _iteration_? If iteration is the repetition of a process in order to generate a sequence of outcomes, what is _iterative development_? 

  * **Iterative Development**: In an iterative approach to development, working software is the primary measure of progress. Our goal is to build functional applications, even if they are very simple, like a skateboard. If we set out to build a sports car, we may never get there and we will have unhappy customers along the way.

  * **What is an MVP?**: It's not _most valuable player_.

  * **Minimum Viable Product**: A minimum viable product is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. [Wikipedia: MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)

  * **How do we determine an MVP?**: How do we know what our minimum viable product is?

  * **Determining a Minimum Viable Product**: There are a lot of approaches to defining a minimum viable product, but we can simplify it to three questions: 1) who is your audience?; 2) what is the problem that the product will address?; 3) how does the product solve that problem?

  * **What is a user story?**: 

  * **User stories**: In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system. [Wikipedia: User story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)

  * **What is acceptance criteria?**: 

  * **Acceptance criteria**: Acceptance criteria define the boundaries of a user story and are used to confirm when a story is completed and working as intended. [Wikipedia: Acceptance criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Acceptance_criteria)

  * **What is an Issue?**:

  * **Issues**: Use issues to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.

### 2. Instructor Do: Demo GitHub Issues (5 min)

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Creating an Issue on GitHub

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Writing a user story 

* Navigate to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) in your browser and explain the following point(s):

  * When we open a project repository, we see next to the `Code` tab an `Issues` tab. 
  
  * If we navigate to the `Issues` tab, we will see any open Issues.

  * If we click the green `New Issue` button, we are routed to a form where we can create a new issue. 

  * When we create an Issue, we want to give it a descriptive and accurate title: 

  ```md
  See referral traffic for inbound analysis
  ```

  ```md
  AS A marketing analyst
  I WANT to see referral traffic
  SO THAT I can adapt strategy to convert more leads
  ```

  * We also want to add acceptance criteria: 

  ```md
  GIVEN I am an authenticated user
  WHEN I request a range of referral traffic 
  THEN a chart is generated
  ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between user stories and issues? 

  * üôã User stories are informal descriptions, whereas issues are our way of tracking features, tasks, bugs, or other improvements. 

### 3. Student Do: User Stories and Issues (5 mins)

* Direct students to follow slide prompt to write a user story for one of the following prompts:

1. A web application that keeps track of a company‚Äôs payroll.

2. A mobile application that finds nearby restaurants.

3. A reminder app that keeps track of important tasks.

* Upon completion, ask a few students to name the prompt they chose, and describe the user story. 

### 4. Instructor Do: Agile, Continued (5 mins)

* Open the slide deck and follow these prompts with their corresponding slides:

  * **What is kanban?**:

  * **Kanban**: Kanban is a project management tool that visualizes work through cards representing User Stories or Issues. In their simplest form, Kanban boards are broken into three columns: To Do; In Progress; Done. Cards begin in the To Do column and are moved from left to right as work is started and completed.

### 5. Instructor Do: GitHub Projects (5 mins)

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Creating a Project on GitHub

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Adding Issues to a Project

* Navigate to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) in your browser and explain the following point(s):

  * We start by creating a repository for our new project.

  * After creating a repository we can set up tracking for our project by selecting the projects tab and clicking on `Create a Project`.

  * Here, we'll name our project and select the Basic Kanban template.

  * Now we can an issue to our board by clicking the `+` icon in the To do column.

  * Alternatively, we can click on `+ Add cards` in the top right to add an existing issue as a card to our project.

  * When the status of a card changes, we update the board by dragging the card into its appropriate column.

  * üéó Remember you can also create an issue by navigating to the `Issues` tab. If you decide to add it to a project, you can select which project the issue is associated with on the right side.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why do we use Kanban boards to track the status of our project. 

  * üôã Kanban boards help you and your team visualize the status of the project. Another advantage of Kanban is that it's much less complex to manage than many other popular methods of project management.

### 6. Student Do: GitHub Projects (10 mins)

* Direct students to the slide prompt to create a GitHub project.

### 7. Instructor Do: Agile, Continued (10 mins)

* Open the slide deck and follow these prompts with their corresponding slides:

  * **What is daily scrum?**: 

  * **Stand-up Meetings**: Stand-up meetings are used to hold teams accountable to each other. Team members make commitments to work on aspects of the project and report out progress. Stand-up meetings are useful in identifying issues as they arise and developing plans to resolve them. There are generally three questions each team member answers in a stand-up: 1) What was accomplished?; 2) What are your goals?; 3) Are there any obstacles to achieving your goals? [Wikipedia: Stand-up meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting)

  * **Project Timeline**: On the first day, we'll divide into groups, write a user story, create a wireframe, create a user flow diagram, and submit a project proposal for approval. We will continue to work on project development until project presentations on the sixth day.

  * **Get Professional**: Remember, projects are your portfolio pieces. Use project week as an opportunity to push yourself and prove your knowledge. Keep you MVP simple and add features as you go to avoid feature creep.

  * **Application Requirements**: 

  * **Presentation Requirements**:

  * **Project Metrics**: Your project will be evaluated on its concept, design, functionality, collaboration, and presentation.

  * **API Suggestions**: It is recommended that you use an API that: Allows CORS, requires simple or no authentication, uses JSON, is well documented.

  * **Today's Project Checklist**: Create a 1 page proposal that contains: Project title, project description, user story, wireframe or sketch of the design, APIs, rough breakdown of tasks.


### 8. Student Do: Break into Teams (40 mins)

* Direct students to begin to work with their groups to identify ideas, research APIs, and create project designs. 

* At your discretion, feel free to utilize TAs and host "workshops" to help steer groups in the right direction. 

  * Many of you may only have a rough idea of what your project will consist of. This is a good opportunity to rule out ideas and get a good sense of what is feasible. 

  * Be cautious of underestimating the amount of time that features will take to implement. Try thinking of the MVP for each idea and attempt to pick the idea that excites your group and seems feasible in the time you have.

### 9. BREAK (15 mins)

### 10. Student Do: Project 1 (75 mins)

* Direct students to the following activities to work through as groups: 

  * [01-Stu_Create-Repository/](../../../../01-Class-Content/07-Project-1/01-Activities/01-Stu_Create-Repository/).

  * [02-Stu_Protect-Master](../../../../01-Class-Content/07-Project-1/01-Activities/02-Stu_Protect-Master/).

  * [03-Stu_Branching-Pushing/Unsolved](../../../../01-Class-Content/07-Project-1/01-Activities/03-Stu_Branching-Pushing/Unsolved/).
