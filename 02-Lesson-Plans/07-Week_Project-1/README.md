# Unit 07: Project-1

## Overview

In this unit, students will begin work on their first Project of the Boot Camp, an API-powered web application that pulls data from multiple sources in a creative way.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/07-Project-1/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

Some students may complain about group configurations, be sure to remind them of the following:

  * In the real-world, you don't get to choose your co-workers.
  * Working collaboratively is an important skill to acquire as a developer.

Make sure to spend plenty of time making sure that students can follow best practices while collaborating with git.

## Heads Up

Next unit, in addition to project work, we will spend a day practicing whiteboard interview questions. Even though the lesson plans are lighter, be sure to review them and spend some time familiarizing yourself with the algorithms. 

Project presentations are on the third day of next unit. Remember, students must have deployed projects by presentation day, so encourage students to work on deploying their projects by 08.2 at the latest. Since you can always update deployed projects, it is recommended that students deploy early on and update their live version with every new feature.
