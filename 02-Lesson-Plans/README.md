# Full Stack Lesson Plans

Here are some general tips and reminders for what to have done at each point of the week.

If you have any outstanding questions, check with your SSM.

## Beginning of the Week

- Review both the instrucor-facing and student-facing Unit Overviews

- Review the homework assignment(s) for this week

- Review the lesson plans for the week

- Ensure homework from previous week(s) is graded

## Before Class Starts

- Do a `git pull` of this repo.

- Refer to the Instructor Notes in the lesson plan and/or the associated time tracker for the range of activities to be covered in class.

- Push any `Unsolved` activities to the class repo for today's lesson. **DO NOT** push `Solved` folders until the end of class.

- If you are at the beginning of the week (or unit for FT), be sure to include the student-facing Unit Overview.

### What NOT to Move into Class Repo

**DO NOT** move anything in this folder, `02-Lesson-Plans` into the class repository. This includes, but is not limited to, the following content:

- Grading Rubrics

- Lesson Plans

- Instructor-facing READMEs (such as this!)

## Beginning of Class

### Instructors

- Start the Panopto recording. Copy/paste the link into the BCS session and slack out to students. Set "Primary Screen" to "Built-In Display" in order to record your active screen.

- Open the day's `LessonPlan.md` file on a second display for yourself.

- Open the entire day's `Activities` folder in your editor to easily move through the examples.

- Have students do a `git pull` of the class repo to have the class activities ready on their machine.

### TAs

- Remind students to mark their attendance in BCS. Edit attendance as needed.

- Open the day's `LessonPlan.md` file and follow along.

- Open the time tracker to help the Instructor keep an eye on time.

## During Class

### All

- Instructional team members should be circulating the room and helping out during activities!

### TAs

- Monitor the time tracker file and collaborate with the Instructor to make adjustments to the class schedule if needed.

- Push `Solved` activities to the class repo after reviewing the solutions together. Students can `git pull`.

## End of Week (or Unit)

- Make the Career Services announcement (found in the Unit Overview)

- Push solutions to any homework assignments that were due.
