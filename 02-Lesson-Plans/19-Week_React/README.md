# Unit 19: React

## Overview

This unit, we will introduce students to React, a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We'll go over key features of the framework: JSX, components, states, props, lifecycle events and so on.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/19-React/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* In order to avoid continuous NPM installs, all of this week's activities' Solved and Unsolved versions include only a `src` folder. Students and yourself should scaffold out a React app once with Create React App, and then swap out the `src` folder for each activity. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

* Students may feel a little overwhelmed with the new unusual syntax. Remind them that at the end of the day, we're still just working with JavaScript. Prioritize making sure they understand concepts, rather than worrying about them perfectly memorizing syntax.

## Heads Up

Next week we will learn more complex techniques for managing state in React. Avoid spending too much time on Class Components, since we will be focusing primarily on using React Hooks, which can only be used at the top level of functional components.
