# Unit 14: Full-Stack

## Overview

This unit, we will introduce students to the Sequelize ORM as well as some validations.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/14-Full-Stack/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* Make sure you change all of the connection information so the examples have your MySQL username/password!

* Be careful not to go to in-depth this unit. There are a ton of components that make Sequelize work, but much of it is boilerplate that doesn't need much explanation.

## Heads Up

Next unit we begin project work, so make sure to set up groups before the first class in the next unit.
