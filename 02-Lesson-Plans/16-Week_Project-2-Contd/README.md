# Unit 16: Project-2-Contd

## Overview

In this unit, we will continue to work on project 2, with presentations on the third day.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/16-Project-2-Contd/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

Encourage students to spend time deciding how they want to present their project before project day presentations.

## Heads Up

Before next unit, make sure you install MongoDB and Robo 3T on your machine--you'll need both.

If you haven't used MongoDB much in the past, take a look at next week's queries and solutions. This should prime you for the lecture.
