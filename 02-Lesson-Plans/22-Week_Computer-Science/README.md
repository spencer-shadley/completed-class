# Unit 22: Computer-Science

## Overview

This unit's lesson plans will introduce students to the fundamental concepts and terminology of computer science. The intent is to provide them with just enough to contextualize technical interview questions and enable further study. We intentionally omit rigorous exercises to allow students to focus on projects.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/22-Computer-Science/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

This unit is intended to be a gentle introduction to computer science topics. Some students may be more excited than others to learn this new material. Be sure to emphasize that knowledge of CS fundamentals will help them in interviews and in their problem-solving abilities.

## Heads Up

Project presentations will take place on the last day of class. You may want to refer to your calendar and determine which day of the week it falls on.
