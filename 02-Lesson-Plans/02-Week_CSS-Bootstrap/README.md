# Unit 02: CSS-Bootstrap

## Overview

In this unit, we will continue diving into CSS and providing students with a thorough series on Bootstrap. Additionally, we'll cover deployments with GitHub Pages.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/02-CSS-Bootstrap/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

This unit, your primary focus as instructors/TAs is to ensure students are able to utilize Github Pages to deploy their websites. Make sure to remind students that although CSS is a broad language with many tricks to learn, they will continue to build their CSS knowledge throughout the entire course.

## Heads Up

Be ready to have your troubleshooting hat on for helping students debug GitHub Pages deploys, as the surface area for problems is somewhat large.

Next unit, we begin JavaScript, make sure to review the slide decks in advance.

Next unit we will also provide students with common problems they will see in interviews. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with these problems so that you can help students with any questions they might have.
