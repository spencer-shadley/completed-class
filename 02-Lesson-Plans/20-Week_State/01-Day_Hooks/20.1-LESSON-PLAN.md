# 20.1 Lesson Plan - Intro to React Hooks (6:30 PM)

## Overview

In this class, we will be introducing students to the concept of React Hooks. We will further expand on their introduction to managing component state and cover side effects, global state, and pure functions. We will introduce three of the most common built-in Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`. Once students have experience creating each one, they will create their own Custom Hooks.

## Instructor Notes

* `Summary: Complete activities 1-7 in Unit 20`.

* As in previous lessons, you will want to scaffold out a React application with Create React App at the beginning of class and suggest students do the same. The activities we go over today will only include the applications `src` folder which you will replace in your React app's boilerplate to avoid repetitive installs. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

* Today's lesson will feature more instructor led demonstrations than the previous class, be sure to spend some time before class reviewing the examples.

## Learning Objectives

* Articulate the term "effect" in the broader sense of programming.

* Utilize React's most common built-in Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

* Transform a React application that manages state with a class component into an application that uses functional components with React Hooks.

* Create a custom reusable Hook that follows the 2 rules of Hooks.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Hooks Slide and Discussion (20 mins)

* Welcome the students to the second main focus of this unit: React Hooks.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mnPdZODvhGs0j6s4EEuATbmQjFM7XpzFxrUnsOzNsGE/edit?usp=sharing)

1. **Discuss Managing State**: Take a moment to talk about managing state.

  * Ask the students to discuss amongst each other how they've managed React state thus far.

  * After a few minutes, collect some different points from the class and discuss some of the pros and cons of both methods.

3. **Class Components vs Context API**: Class components paired with the `setState` method is the most common way to manage state.

  * Benefits:

  * Setting state will force the component to re-render. This ensures that the component and all of its children will be up-to-date with the latest state.

  * Drawbacks:

  * Since state only flows in one direction, all components that need to use the state must be children of the stateful component.

  * Updating state from deep within the component hierarchy is often difficult.

  * You are forced to use the keyword `this` and use a class component.

  * The Context API is another tool that can be used to manage state.

  * Benefits:

  * Updating state from deep within the component hierarchy is made to be easier since "prop drilling" can be avoided.

  * Drawbacks:

  * The most effective way to manage complex states still requires the use of `setState` to ensure that the latest changes are reflected in each component.

4. **Managing State**: Managing state can be difficult since there is no one-size-fits-all solution.

  * If your application is complex, it might warrant the use of a state management library like mobX or Redux.

  * If your application only has a few stateful properties, the best solution may be managing state in a single component.

  * There is no "right" way to manage your state. The more applications that you create, the better you will become at gauging what the right state management tool is for the job.

  * For all situations that have states that are too complex for a single component, and not complex enough for Redux or MobX, we use Hooks.

6. **Hooks**: Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

  * For all situations that have states that are too complex for a single component, and not complex enough for Redux or MobX, we use Hooks.

  * React has no plans to deprecate class components, but Hooks can do everything a class component can and more.

7. **The 4 Hooks**: We will be covering for different kind of Hooks.

  * `useState` allows you to use state in a functional component.

  * `useEffect` replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`.

  * An **effect**, also commonly referred to as a **side effect**, is a term used to describe the result of affecting the ‚Äúoutside world‚Äù.

  * This includes, but is not limited to: Data fetching, subscribing to events, and changes to the DOM.

  * `useContext` grants read access to a Context Object as long as it is being used within the object's Provider.

   * We will be covering the built-in Hooks `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`, but emphasize that there are many more Hooks. The strong developer community around React has created a plethera of different Custom Hooks that you can plug into your applications.

  * Custom Hooks can be any reusable function, often built from logic extracted from existing functions.

8. **2 Rules of Hooks**: There are 2 rules of Hooks that must be complied with:

  * Only call Hooks from top-level components. This means **never** call Hooks from within loops, conditionals, or nested functions.

  * It is important that Hooks are always called in the same order, like component lifecycle methods.

  * It is also what makes it possible for React to store the state of Hooks when using useState or useEffect.

9. **2 Rules of Hooks**

  * Hooks may only be called from React components. **Never** call a Hook from a regular JavaScript function.

  * This makes it so that all stateful logic is easy to find for the developer.

### 3. Instructor Do: useState Demo (10 mins)

* Run `08-Ins_useState` by copying the `src` folder into your prepared CRA application. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * When the application loads, 'Status' is set to the default string, 'content'.

  * Clicking the 'Encourage Laziness' button changes 'Status' to 'lazy'.

  * Clicking the 'Fill with Determination' button changes 'Status' to 'determined'.

* Open [08-Ins_useState/src/App.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/08-Ins_useState/src/App.js) in your IDE and explain the following:

  * From React, we import `useState`.

  ```js
  import React, { useState } from "react";
  ```

  * `useState` is a built-in Hook that will _always_ return an array of two elements. The first returned element is a snapshot of the current state. The second returned element is a function that allows us to _overwrite_ the current state.

  * We destructure the array returned from `useState` into two variables: `developerState` and `setDeveloperState`, and initialize state with an object containing `mood`, `lifeLongLearner` and `excitementLevel` properties.

  ```js
  const [developerState, setDeveloperState] = useState({
    mood: "content",
    lifeLongLearner: true,
    excitementLevel: 9000
    })
  ```

  * üìù The function will _not_ merge with the existing state as `setState` does. This means that whatever is passed into useState will _overwrite_ the object that was previously there.

  * The `changeMood` function accepts a parameter, `mood`, and calls the `setDeveloperState` method:

  ```js
  const changeMood = (mood) => {
    setDeveloperState({
      mood: mood,
      lifeLongLearner: developerState.lifeLongLearner,
      excitementLevel: developerState.excitementLevel
    });
  };
  ```

  * üìù If we want to change _just one_ property, such as `mood`, with `setDeveloperState`, we need to update the entire object, not just the property in question. This is because `setDeveloperState` _overwrites_ the previous state, instead of merging it with the existing state, as `this.setState` does.

  * üí°To avoid repeating yourself, you can shorten this code by using the spread notation `...`. Like `setDeveloperState({...developerState, mood})`.

  * Setting the `onClick` attribute to an arrow function that _returns_ the function that we want to call when the button is clicked.

  ```js
  <button onClick={()=>changeMood("lazy")}>Encourage Laziness</button>
  <button onClick={()=>changeMood("determined")}>Fill with Determination</button>
  ```

  * If we were to pass it the function by itself, then the `changeMood` function would be _called_ directly, resulting in an infinite loop.

* Answer any questions before beginning the activity.

### 4. Students Do: useState Activity (15 mins)

Files: [09-Stu_useState/Unsolved](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/09-Stu_useState/Unsolved)

```md
  In this activity we will practice using the useState hook in React.

  ## Instructions

  * Replace your React application's¬†src¬†folder with [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src).

  * If you created a new React app, you will need to add the Bootstrap link to `index.html`.

  * Start the application in dev mode by running `npm start` in your terminal.

  * Open your browser to¬†[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)¬†and study the rendered application.

  * Update this application to accomplish the following:

  * In `pages/Signup/index.js`, replace `NAME_HERE` and `PASSWORD_HERE` with code that will display both the name and password.

  * The state of the Signup component should be handled by the useState Hook.

  * When the value of an input field changes, the state should update, causing the component to render.

  * Upon form submission, the `handleSubmit` method should `console.log` the username and password.
```

### 5. Instructor Do: Review useState Activity (10 mins)

* Run [09-Stu_useState/Solved](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/09-Stu_useState/Solved) by copying the `src` folder into your prepared CRA application. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Email and password values entered into the input fields are rendered in the DOM.

* Open `src/pages/Signup/index.js` and explain the following:

  * We import `useState` from `react`:

  ```js
  import React, { useState } from "react";
  ```

  * Using array destructuring, we initialize `username` and `password` variables for state and `setUsername` and `setPassword` setter methods, by invoking `useState` twice:

  ```js
   const [username, setUsername] = useState();
   const [password, setPassword] = useState();
   ```

  * üîë Since we're not specifying a default value, we won't pass anything to `useState()`.

  * üéóÔ∏è `useState` overwrites the current state instead of merging state like `this.setState` does.

  * In the `<input>` components in the `return` block, we use the `onChange` method to call our setter methods for username and password and pass each the value of the target that triggered the event:

  ```js
    <Col size="12">
      <input
        className="form-control"
        type="text"
        placeholder="Username"
        name="username"
        onChange={e => setUsername(e.target.value)}
      />
    </Col>
  </Row>
  <Row className="form-group">
    <Col size="12">
      <input
        className="form-control"
        type="password"
        placeholder="Password"
        name="password"
        onChange={e => setPassword(e.target.value)}
      />
    </Col>
  ```

* Some students may have tried to use the `value` attribute. Ask them why using `value` with `onChange` might be a bad idea.

* It all comes down to controlled input vs uncontrolled input.

  * **Controlled input** accepts its current value as a prop and has a callback that allows you to change its value. Whenever `onChange` updates its value, it's essentially the input controlling itself.

  * **Uncontrolled input** is an input that gets its value from somewhere else. In our case, if `value={username}`, then the input would be getting its value from the state.  

  * The combination of the two would result in the component going from uncontrolled to controlled, which is considered bad practice.

### 6. Instructor Do: useEffect Demo (10 mins)

* Next, we will introduce students to the `useEffect` Hook.

  * Let the students know that effects, often referred to as side effects, are bits of code responsible for the modification of state, often in the "outside world". In React, effects are most commonly used for data fetching and manually changing the DOM.

  * For example, if one were to create a method that is responsible for creating a user, they could separate it into one regular method that creates the object/validates the data and one effect method that saves the user to a database.

* Open up [10-Ins_useEffect/App.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/10-Ins_useEffect/App.js) in your IDE.

  * Let the students know that `useEffect` is a method that takes two arguments.

  * The first argument is a function that you want to run after the component mounts.

  * The second argument is an array of dependencies, commonly referred to as "deps". Every time the component re-renders, the `useEffect` Hook will check to see if any of the values in its dependency array have changed. If they have, then the function that you supplied as the first argument of `useEffect` will run again. If not, React will skip the effect for that particular render.

  * Ex: If `[props.name]` is provided, then `useEffect` will run once upon initial page render, then once every subsequent render that is caused by a change in `props.name`.

  * When an empty array is provided, `useEffect` will only run when the component renders the first time.

  * Explain that if we supplied `developerState` as a dependency, it would cause an infinite loop. This is because every single time `developerState` would change, it would call `useEffect`, forcing `developerState` to change again.

  ```js
  useEffect(() => {
    // For demonstration purposes, we mock an API call.
    const developer = getDeveloper();
    setDeveloperState(developer);
    console.log("Developer State:");
    console.log(developerState);
  }, []);
  ```

* Open your browser again and demonstrate that the state appears in the console once upon page render, then after every time a button is pressed.

  * Recall that the button click still uses the `useState` hook, which causes the component to re-render.

### 7. Students Do: useEffect Activity (20 mins)

Files: [11-Stu_useEffect/Unsolved/src/App.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/08-Ins_useState/Unsolved/src/App.js)

```md
  In this activity we will practice using the useState and useEffect Hooks in React by transforming a stateful class component into a functional component with React Hooks.

  ## Instructions

  * Replace your React application's¬†src¬†folder with [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src).

  * If you created a new React app, you will need to install axios and React Router.

  * Start the application in dev mode by running `npm start` in your terminal.

  * Open your browser to¬†[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)¬†and study the rendered application.

  * Update this application to accomplish the following:

  * Create a functional component in place of the class component.

  * Replace `this.state` and all instances of `this.setState` using the `useState` Hook.

  * Update the component with the `useEffect` Hook to eliminate the need for `componentDidMount`.

```

### 8. Instructor Do: Review useEffect (10 mins)

* Run [11-Stu_useEffect/Solved/](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/08-Ins_useState/Solved/) by copying the `src` folder into your prepared CRA application. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The application immediately queries the Wikipedia API based on input.

* Open `11-Stu-useEffect/Solved/src/pages/Search/index.js` and explain the following:

  * All of the states have been set up at the top of the file.

  ```js
  const [search, setSearch] = useState("Wikipedia");
  const [title, setTitle] = useState("");
  const [description, setDescription] = useState("");
  const [url, setUrl] = useState("");
  const [error, setError] = useState("");
  ```

  * üìù `search` is the only term provided with a default value. We could also create a single object to hold the values, but in using separate Hooks our code is more readable and manages state better. We pass `search` to the `useEffect` hook in the 'deps' array. `useEffect` will run when the component mounts, then after each time the value in the search input field changes.

  ```js
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = "Wikipedia Searcher";
    if(!search) {
      return;
    }
    API.searchTerms(search)
      .then(res => {
        if(res.data.length === 0) {
          throw new Error("No results found.");
        }
        if (res.data.status === "error") {
          throw new Error(res.data.message);
        }
        setTitle(res.data[1]);
        setDescription(res.data[2][0]);
        setUrl(res.data[3][0]);
      })
      .catch(err => setError(err));
  }, [state]);
  ```

  * The `if(!search)` conditional ensures that we do not run a query if the input field is empty.

  * The `handleInputChange` method now simply uses our `setSearch` hook.

  ```js
  const handleInputChange = event => {
      setSearch(event.target.value);
    };
  ```

* Ask students the following questions:

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What was the point of this? (Feel free to make a bad pun here).

  * üôã Writing functional components is much cleaner. Using Hooks allows you to write fewer lines of code and manage your state in a less complex way. (No `this` keyword required!)

  * ‚òùÔ∏è If we use Hooks, can state be used by other components?

  * üôã No. The state used within a single component cannot be used by different components.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Can you think of a concept that would allow us to share state across components?

  * üôã We can add this functionality by using the Context API with the built in `useContext` Hook.

### 9. Everyone Do: Break (15 mins)

### 10. Instructor Do: Custom Hooks Demo (10 mins)

* Take a moment to ask the class to recite the two rules of Hook.

  * Only call Hooks from top-level components. This means **never** call Hooks from within loops, conditionals, or nested functions.

  * Hooks may only be called from React components. **Never** call a Hook from a regular JavaScript function.

* Next, introduce the class to the concept of custom Hooks. Remind the class that the two rules of Hooks still apply to custom Hooks.

  * Custom Hooks can be practically anything! Custom Hooks are best suited to extract logic that may be repeated.

  * Custom Hooks are a great way to keep your React functions pure.

* In addition to the two rules of Hooks, let students know that custom Hooks must start with the word `use` so that React can ensure that your code is adhering to the two rules of Hooks.

* Let students know that just as with `useState` and `useEffect`, different components that use the same custom Hook do **not** share the same state. If you wish to have two components that use the same state, you should use `useContext` or combine and custom Hook with `useContext`.

* Open [CustomHook Demo](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/05-Ins_CustomHook/) in your browser.

  * Show students that when you change the value of the `name` input field, the corresponding section in the card updates.

  * Open the console and demonstrate that every change in either field causes an object to be logged.

* Open [useUserModel.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/05-Ins_CustomHook/src/utils/useUserModel.js) in your IDE.

  * The purpose of this Hook is to control the user model. Each property of the `userModel` will be an object with the properties `value` and a method for changing the value named `onChange`.

  * Point out that the Custom Hook is a top level function. Within it we can use Hooks like `useEffect` and `useState`.

  * Our Hook starts with the word `use` so that we can easily identify it.

  * We set the `nameState` and `statusState` to have default string values. ImageState is set to a default image from our `assets` folder.

  * The Hook returns an object with an `error` property that will return an error if the `nameState` is ever left empty.

  ```js
  import { useState } from 'react';

  import profileImage from "../assets/images/profile.png";

  const useUserModel = () => {
    let [nameState, setName] = useState('Bob')
    let [statusState, setStatus] = useState('Excited');
    let [imageState, setImage] = useState(profileImage);

    return {
      error: nameState === '' ? 'Please enter a name' : "",
      name: {
        value: nameState,
        onChange: e => setName(e.target.value),
      },
      image: {
        value: imageState,
        onChange: e => setImage(e.target.value),
      },
      status: {
        value: statusState,
        onChange: e => setStatus(e.target.value),
      }
    }
  }

  export default useUserModel;

  ```

* Open [App.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/05-Ins_CustomHook/src/App.js) and explain the following:

  * Our state is managed with a Context Object called `UserContext`.

  * The `useEffect` hook is **only** being used to show the developer every time that `userModel` changes.

  ```js
  import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
  import './App.css';

  import useUserModel from "./utils/useUserModel";
  import UserContext from "./utils/UserContext";
  import UserCard from './components/UserCard';
  import UserForm from './components/UserForm';

  const App = () => {

    const userModel = useUserModel();

    useEffect(() => {
      console.log(userModel)

    }, [userModel]);

    return (
      <div className="container text-center">
        <h1 className="mt-4 mb-4">Welcome to the Person Creator!</h1>
        <div className="jumbotron">
          <UserContext.Provider value={ userModel }>
            <UserForm />
            <UserCard />
          </UserContext.Provider>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  };

  export default App;
  ```



### 11. Students Do: Custom Hooks (15 mins)

* Introduce [CustomHook Unsolved](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/06-Stu_CustomHook/Unsolved)

* In this activity we will practice using Custom Hooks by creating a `useDebounce` Hook that will delay the invoking of a function for a given number of milliseconds.

```md

  * Replace your React application's¬†src¬†folder with [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src).

  * Start the application in dev mode by running `npm start` in your terminal.

  * Open your browser to¬†[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)¬†and study the rendered application.

  * Update this application to accomplish the following:

  * Create a new Custom Hook called `useDebounce` that takes in the two parameters `value` and `delay`.

  * Use `setTimeout` to handle the value of the debouncer.

  * Update the `Search` page so that the useEffect Hook is listening for the value returned from the `useDebounce` Hook. Pass in a `delay` value of 500.

  * The finished application should only search for a new article if there has been a period of 500 milliseconds without any user input.

```

### 12. Instructor Do: Review Custom Hooks (10 mins)

* Open [15-Stu_CustomHooks/](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/15-Stu_CustomHooks/) in your browser.

  * Type `software developer` into the Article Search Bar.

  * Point out that the article below the search bar only updated once you finished typing.

  * Slowly type out each letter of `software developer` and demonstrate that the API call occurs if there has been a period of over 500 milliseconds without any input changing.

* Open [15-Stu_CustomHooks/Solved/src/utils/debounceHook.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/15-Stu_CustomHooks/Solved/src/utils/debounceHook.js) in your IDE and point out the following:

  * We will use the `useEffect` and `useState` Hooks in our custom Hook.

  * Our Custom Hook starts with the word `use`.

  * `useDebounce` takes in two parameters: `value` and `delay`.

  * The state is controlled with a Hook at the top level of our `useDebounce` Hook.

  * We create a `setTimeout` method and set it to a variable called `handler` so that we may later `clearTimeout`.

  * We `return` a function that clears the timeout.

  * Inside the `useEffect` Hook, if a `return` statement is provided, then the function that is returned gets run every time the component unmounts **or** right before the next `useEffect` is called. This is known as a "cleanup" function because it is designed to tie up the loose ends in effects that are dependant on outside effects. In our case, the outside effect is the `handler` timeout we created.

  ```js
  import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

  const useDebounce = (value, delay) => {
    const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);
    useEffect(() => {
      const handler = setTimeout(() => {
        setDebouncedValue(value);
      }, delay);
      // Cancel the timeout if value or delay changes
      return () => {
        clearTimeout(handler);
      };
    },
    // Only call the effect if value or delay changes.
    [value, delay]
    );

    return debouncedValue;
  };
  export default useDebounce;
  ```

* Open [15-Stu_CustomHooks/Solved/src/utils/debounceHook.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/15-Stu_CustomHooks/Solved/src/utils/debounceHook.js) in your IDE and point out the following:

  * The `debouncedSearchTerm` variable is set up **outside** of the `useEffect` Hook. We pass in the existing `search` variable that is tied to our component state and pass in 500 as our second parameter.

  * First, we will check to make sure that the input text is not empty.

  * Then we ensure that `debouncedSearchTerm` is not `undefined` or `null`.

  * `useEffect` receives `debouncedSearchTerm` so that it will only run when the debounced term changes instead of running whenever `search` changes.

```js
const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(search, 500);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = "Wikipedia Searcher";
    if(!search) {
      return;
    }
    if(debouncedSearchTerm) {
      API.searchTerms(search)
        .then(res => {
          if(res.data.length === 0) {
            throw new Error("No results found.");
          }
          if (res.data.status === "error") {
            throw new Error(res.data.message);
          }
          setArticleState({
            title: res.data[1],
            description: res.data[2][0],
            url: res.data[3][0]
          });
        })
        .catch(err => setError(err));
    }

  }, [debouncedSearchTerm]);
```

### 14. Students Do: Third Party Hooks (20 mins)

* If time permits, introduce students to [16-ThirdPartyHooks/Unsolved/](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/16-ThirdPartyHooks/Unsolved/README.md). Since this activity uses third party Hooks, only proceed with this activity if the students seem to have a solid grasp of Hooks. Otherwise, spend the rest of class answering lingering questions, reviewing, and skimming over the solution with the class.

  * In this activity we will practice using third party Hooks. Specifically, we will be creating a survey form using the `react-hanger` package on npm.

  * Let the students know that `react-hanger` is one of many custom Hooks packages on GitHub. This package contains multiple custom 

  ```md
  * Replace your React application's¬†src¬†folder with [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src).

  * Install react-hanger by running `npm install react-hanger` in your terminal.

  * **Recommended:** Add the Bootstrap and Font Awesome CDNs to your application's `index.html` file:

    ```html
    <link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
    ```

  * Start the application in dev mode by running `npm start` in your terminal.

  * Open your browser to¬†[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)¬†and study the rendered application.

    * There are a few fields in our survey form. Before writing any code, try thinking about how you would manage the state of this form. 

  * Navigate to the [react-hanger docs](https://github.com/kitze/react-hanger) familiarize yourself with the `useInput`, `useBoolean`, and `useNumber` Hooks.

  * Update this application to accomplish the following:

    * Each user input should be handled using the `react-hanger` Hooks.

    * When the user clicks an emoji, indicate which type of response they selected by displaying the text: `You responded that you feel FEELING`. `FEELING` should be replaced with the value of the emoji that they clicked.

    * Make your survey form a little more dynamic by displaying a field for additional comments when the user clicks on an emoji.

    * When the form is submitted, `console.log` an object containing all of the values from the form.

  ### Hints

  * There are many ways to satisfy the requirements of this application. It is recommended that you attempt the most straightforward solution first, then refactor your working app.

### 15. Instructor Do: Review Third Party Hooks (10 mins)

* Replace your React application's src folder with [16-ThirdPartyHooks/Solved](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/16-ThirdPartyHooks/Solved/src) and start the development server by running `npm start`. See the rendered application at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

* Demonstrate that the application satisfies the requirements:

  * Fill out each field in the form with dummy data.

  * Click `submit`.

  * Open the console and show that the form object contains the value from each field.

* Open [Survey/index.js solved](../../../../01-Class-Content/20-state/01-Activities/16-ThirdPartyHooks/Solved/src/pages/Survey/index.js) in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Even though we used `textarea` instead of `input`, we can still use the `useInput` hook.

  * `showComment` is initialized to `false` so that the additional input field is not visible initially.

  * Since we will be setting the rating manually, we do not need to give it upper and lower bounds.

  ```js
  const favoriteThing = useInput("");
  const showComment = useBoolean(false);
  const comment = useInput("");
  const feeling = useInput("");
  const rating = useNumber(0)
  ```

  * Our form object contains the value of each field. Since `showComment` is only used for display purposes, we do **not** include it in the form object.

  ```js
  const handleSubmit = () => {
    const form = {
      favoriteThing: favoriteThing.value,
      comment: comment.value,
      feeling: feeling.value,
      rating: rating.value
    }
    console.log(form)
  }
  ```

  * `...favoriteThing.eventBind` binds both the `value` and the `onChange` props of an element, as long as it has a `event.target.value`.

  * This single method would also work with input fields and select elements.

  ```js
  <textarea {...favoriteThing.eventBind} />
  ```

  * It is very important that we include `role="img"` and `aria-label="angry"` to make the emojis accessible.

  * The onClick method toggles our `showComment` boolean and sets the feeling value to angry.

  ```js
  <span role="img" aria-label="angry" 
    onClick={() => {showComment.toggle(); feeling.setValue("angry")} }>
      üò†
  </span>
  ```

  * We use a ternary operator so that the additional comments textarea only renders if the `showComment` boolean is true.

  * Once again, `onClick` and `value` are bound to the comment variable.

  ```js
  <div className="response">
    {showComment.value ? (
      <textarea {...comment.eventBind} placeholder="Please add any additional comments" />
    ): null}
  </div>
  ```
