# Unit 20: State

## Overview

In this unit, we will be covering state management techniques in React. We will cover React Hooks, the Context API, and creating a Redux-like store.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/20-State/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* This unit includes some cutting edge state management techniques that are best utilized in complex systems. Reassure students that are struggling that this unit is meant to serve as an introduction to more complex systems, and may take a while to fully grasp.

* 20.3 will rely heavily on Redux concepts. It is recommended that you spend some time getting familiar with the activities before class starts.

## Heads Up

Next unit we will start project 3. In the following unit we will cover Computer Science basics, so be sure to brush up on BigO, sorting, and algorithm basics.
