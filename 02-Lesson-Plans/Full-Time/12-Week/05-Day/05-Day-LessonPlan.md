# 12.5 Final Project Presentations (10:00 AM)

In this lecture, your students will present their project apps to the class. They’ll afterwards answer open-floor questions from you, TAs and classmates. This is a **crucial** lecture for your students, so make sure you follow the advice in this plan.

## Instructor Priorities

* Students should expect an extended class today--these presentations tend to last longer than our allotted time.

* Students should know the parts of their apps that impress you and the TAs, as well as what they can improve on for future projects. This will help direct their focus for future assignments (what aspects of web development they need to work on).

## Instructor Notes

* Arrive early to support students, and get the room set up.

* Have your TAs reference [05-Day-Time-Tracker](https://drive.google.com/a/trilogyed.com/file/d/1Wyx9aC4lKA5UaQjunQZcExJG-iX32a2_/view?usp=sharing) to help keep track of time during class.

## Class Objectives

* _Arrive early to class_ so that you can set the room up for presentations.

* To provide students more time and support for their group projects.

### 1. Introduce Presentations (10 mins)

* Be sure you are all setup for presentations.

* Congratulate your class for developing their projects to a state worth presenting.

* Tell students to deploy their latest changes to GitHub. When they demonstrate their project, they'll clone their files to the projector's computer.

  * Make sure groups have deployed their app to Heroku, as well. We want to see their projects in action.

* Give students a rundown of how they're presentations should pan out.

  1. They should last about eight minutes, followed by two-to-four minutes of open-floor Q&A.
  2. They need to show confidence! All of them have contributed to impressive projects--they need to recognize and project that during their demonstrations.

* Ask which groups would like to go first, then second, then third and so on. When groups stop responding, assign the remaining teams to random slots (and write this list down).

### 2. Presentations Pt.1 (105 mins)

* Go down the list and send each group up to the front of class. Give students roughly three minutes of setup time.

* When a group nears the 9-minute mark, motion for them to draw their presentation to a close (like pointing to your watch/imaginary watch). **Don't say anything**--you don't want your voice to interrupt them & throw them off.

* Follow each of these presentations up with questions about their projects. Let TAs and classmates ask questions, too.

* When the Q&A session ends, point out what you found impressive and what they can improve on for future demonstrations.

* When a group finishes after 12pm, announce a break.

### 3. Lunch (30 mins)

### 4. Presentations Pt.2 (110 mins)

* Just like in step 2, send each group up to the front of class when their turn comes.

* When the last group finishes, tell each of them that they should put their projects up on LinkedIn, with links to their GitHub and Heroku deployments.

* Congratulate them! It's challenging to conceive, develop and present a new web app. Remind them how much they've learned over the past 6 months.

* Dismiss the class.

### 5. Introduce Portfolio Update (10 mins)

Open up the instructions for updating the students portfolio

* [Portfolio Update Instructions](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-portfolio-update/01-Homework/Instructions/README.md)

* Explain to students the importance of having an up-to-date portfolio, whether it be for the job search or just networking! Let them know how proud you are of the hard work they have done and to go ahead and update their portfolios to add and show off this finished project.

### 6. After Project Demos (5 mins)

After students have presented their projects, please take some time to submit their work to the form below. This will assist future instructional staff.

### 7. End (0 mins)
