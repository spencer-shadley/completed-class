# Unit 11 and 12: Express and MySQL

## Overview

This unit is focused on learning how server-side code works and creating an Express-based web server. Students will be introduced to the concepts of routing, request/response handling, and GET/POST requests.

We will also start working with databases by introducing MySQL and SQL queries before connecting them to Node and user-input.

## Instructor / TA Notes

This unit, there is a larger focus on the concept of server-side code. Make sure that the class can explain the purpose of server-side code to you before moving on to Express. 

Students' first exposure to MySQL is most likely going to seem overwhelming. Make sure to keep your class calm and reassure them that all of this will make more sense as they spend more time with the language and MySQL Workbench.

Since MySQL has the potential to bring about a lot of errors on its inaugural setup, we have set aside portions of time for the critical assignments for you and your TA's to assist the class as necessary over the course of this unit's activities.

## Heads Up

This week we also start on MySQL. Make sure that you send out the instructions for installing to install MySQL before the midweek to minimize install time next unit.

In the next unit we will be working with ORMs and Handlebars. Before jumping into Handlebars, we will be going over how to send MySQL data from the back-end to the front-end. Be prepared to spend some extra time on Express before starting Handlebars.
