# 21.3 Lesson Plan - React.js / Project #3 (10:00 AM)

## Overview

After doing a review of Databases and React and giving some help and time for students to work on their homework, you'll prime your students to conceptualize their final projects. You'll run down the list of expectations and requirements for each of their weekly deliverables. Aside from that, you and the TAs will stick around to make sure each team has a solid idea for their project--they should have one by the end of the class.

## Learning Objectives

* To lead a review time with your students for any questions they may still have about prior material since their second project. Primarily Database and React content.

* To help students with their current homework assignment as it is a hard one!

* To spur students to flesh out some finial project ideas, recruit team members, and figure out what their apps will do.

* To complete the React Checkpoint

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Lead a review on React Hooks, Context, and Store (60 mins)

* We are going to open today's class with a review on some content we covered in last week's classes. Primarily, we will be reviewing Hooks in React and managing state in preparation for your final projects.

* Open the floor to students with specific questions about anything they may not be clear on, including any material that overflowed from the review we had last class.

* After students have had time to ask specific questions, go into a basic review of managing state in React.

### 2. Everyone Do: Work on homework! (50 mins)

* Now its time for students to do some work on their Homework and get help with whatever they may be stuck on!

### 3. BREAK (40 mins)

### 4. Students Do: Continue Working on Projects (90 mins)

* Continue along the same path as the last class with projects until class ends.

* Make sure you go to each group that has yet to submit anything about their app and help them figure out the direction they should move in.

  * If a group can't submit their four items by the end of class, they must at least send them by the end of the day (and really, who wants to work outside of class on a Saturday)?

### 5. End (0 mins)

### 6. TAs Do: Structured Office Hours - Review React (30 mins)

* Navigate in your browser to: `https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/checkpoint-bank/blob/master/checkpoints/multiple-choice/10-React-MC/10-ES6-React-MC.md`

* There you will find the questions and answers to the Checkpoint given.

* Please take the entire office hours time to review the questions with the students.

* Suggestion Format:

  * TAs ask a question at a time to the class.

  * Let the students try to answer it.

    * If you see that a majority of the class has a misunderstanding with a question:

      * Take your time on this question!

    * If you see that a small number of students has a misunderstanding with a question:

      * Do your best to reinforce the misunderstanding but be cautious of your time.

      * Make note of the students that are still struggling with the question and schedule a 1:1 with the students.

  * If applicable, demo the answer.

* Take your time on these questions!

* This is a great time to reinforce concepts and misunderstandings!

# Instructor Do: Private Self-Reflection (0 mins)
