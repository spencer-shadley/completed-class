# Unit 12: MySQL

## Overview

In this week, we are starting working with databases by introducing MySQL and SQL queries before connecting them to Node and user-input.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/12-MySQL/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

Students' first exposure to MySQL is most likely going to seem overwhelming. Make sure to keep your class calm and reassure them that all of this will make more sense as they spend more time with the language and MySQL Workbench.

Since MySQL has the potential to bring about a lot of errors on its inaugural setup, we have set aside portions of time for the critical assignments for you and your TA's to assist the class as necessary over the course of this unit's activities.

## Heads Up

In the next unit we will be working with ORMs and Handlebars. Before jumping into Handlebars, we will be going over how to send MySQL data from the back-end to the front-end. Be prepared to spend some extra time on Express before starting Handlebars.
