# 08.3 - Project Presentations #1 (10:00 AM)

## Overview

Students present their projects to their peers.

- Project presentations are a rare opportunity for students to practice speaking on technical topics in front of an audience of peers.

- Limit presentations to 10 minutes: 7 or 8 for the presentation itself followed by 2 or 3 minutes for Q & A. This will ensure that every group presents and allow padding for transitions between groups.

- Prior to class, prepare a list of questions to ask each group to encourage discussion.

- Prior to class, and during presentations if necessary, collaborate with your TAs to prepare a slide deck of superlative "awards" for groups. Refer to [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing).

## Learning Objectives

- Speak technically about a feature implemented in the group project

- Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for the project
