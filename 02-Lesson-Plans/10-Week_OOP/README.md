# Unit 10: OOP

## Overview

In this class we will be introducing students to the usage of JavaScript constructors, classes and the concept of TDD.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* Constructors and classes are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types and allow for the development of very interesting applications. Try to 

* We will also spend a day this unit practicing TDD. Since students have limited exposure to testing, emphasize the importance and benefits of testing. Remind students that just like with other libraries syntax will fall into place over time.

## Heads Up

Next unit, we will be diving into servers and Express. Spend as much time as you can making sure that students understand Node.js fundamentals. 

Many students will benefit from more information about prototypal inheritance. Try to provide these students with the resources they need to succeed, but avoid spending too much in-class time if you notice that it's discouraging to struggling students.
