## Homework 

For part-time students, homework is assigned on the first day of the week (or unit if the calendar is shifted by a holiday or event) and is due _the following_ Saturday, so students have nearly two weeks to submit.

_Note: The following are default days of the week that HW is assigned/due in BCS and are subject to change with holidays._

### Monday/Tuesday - After Class

* Copy the new homework instructions and, if applicable, `Develop` folder into the class repo.

### Saturday of the Following Week - After Class

* Last week's homework is due.

* Copy the homework `Master` folder into the class repo.
