## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ☝️ What is an object?

  * 🙋 Objects are a data structure allowing for us to store properties and methods in a `key:value` pairing.

* Navigate to [07-Stu_Tamagotchi](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/07-Tamagotchi/Solved/tamagotchi-this.js) and open it in your terminal.

* Enter the command `node tamagotchi-this dog letInside` in your terminal and show students the output.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ☝️ What would we need to know to make this application with objects?

  * 🙋 By the end of the class we will know everything necessary to create this CLI Application.

### 2. Students Do: Raining Cats and Dogs (10 mins)

* Direct students to the activity found in [01-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/01-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs)

```md
# Cats and Dogs

In this activity you will make a cat object and dog object each with three keys.

## Instructions

* Make a dogs object with three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of true

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining dogs

* Next make a cats object with three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of false

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining cats

* Make the dog bark

* Make the cat meow

## 🏆BONUS

* Create a function called "massHysteria" which takes in both the cats and the dogs object and prints "DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!" if both of the `raining` keys are equal to true.

* See if there is anyway to further optimize your code.
```

### 3. Instructor Do: Review Raining Cats and Dogs (10 mins)

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

  * ✔️ We create a `makeNoise` key and give it the value of a function.

  * ✔️ We use dot notation to call methods contained in our object.

  * ✔️ We can change the value of a key using dot notation as well.

* Open [01-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs Solved/script.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/01-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs/Solved) in your IDE and explain the following points to students:

  * 🔑 We create a `makeNoise` key and give it the value of a function.

  ```js
  makeNoise: function() {
    if (this.raining === true) {
      console.log(this.noise);
      }
    }
  };
  ```

  * 🔑 We use dot notation to call methods contained in our object.

  ```js
  dogs.makeNoise();
  ```

  * 🔑 We can change the value of a key using dot notation as well.

  ```js
  cats.raining = true;
  ```
  
  * 🔑 We create a function `massHysteria` which will take in a dogs object and cats object and check that BOTH have a key:value of `raining: true`. 

  ```js
  const massHysteria = function(dogs, cats) {
  if (dogs.raining === true && cats.raining === true) {
    console.log("DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!");
    }
  };
  ```

  * 🔑 Finally we invoke our function passing in our two objects.

  ```js
  massHysteria(dogs, cats);
  ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ☝️ What if we wanted to create multiple different animal objects from a blueprint?

  * 🙋 We can use a constructor function to create objects based on a structure we specify.

* Use the discussion to transition to the next topic.

### 4. Instructor Do: Cats and Dogs with Constructors! (10 min)

* Navigate to [02-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/02-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors/rainingCatsAndDogs-con.js) and open it in your IDE.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ☝️ What difference do you from the previous activity we worked on?

  * 🙋 We create a constructor function called `Animals`, instead of individual cat and dog objects.

  * ☝️ Why is `Animal` upper-cased. ️

  * 🙋 It is a common naming convention to upper-case the names of constructor functions, as well as classes.

* With [02-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/02-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors/rainingCatsAndDogs-con.js) open in your IDE, point out the following to students:

  * ✔️ We first declare a constructor function named `Animal`. It will take 2 parameters which will be passed into our keys as their value.

  ```js
  function Animal(raining, noise) {
    this.raining = raining;
    this.noise = noise;
  ```

  * ✔️ We give our object a key of `makeNoise` thats value is a function. The function checks if the `raining` key's value is `true`. If it is `console.log` the value of the key `noise`.

  ```js
  this.makeNoise = function() {
    if (this.raining === true) {
      console.log(this.noise);
    }
  };
  ```

  * ✔️ We create a new object via our constructor function using the `new` keyword. We pass in the values we want our keys to have as arguments to the constructor.

  ```js
  var dogs = new Animal(true, "Woof!");
  var cats = new Animal(false, "Meow!");
  ```

  * ✔️ We can now invoke the `makeNoise` method on our created objects.

  ```js
  dogs.makeNoise();
  cats.makeNoise();
  ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ☝️ How are constructors useful?

  * 🙋 They allow us to create as many objects as we want, all from a single blueprint. This lessens redundant code.

  * Use the discussion to transition to the next activity.

### 5. Student Do: MiniBank (10 mins)

* Direct students to the next activity, found in [03-Stu_Mini-Bank](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/03-Stu_Mini-Bank/Unsolved).

```md
# MiniBank

In this activity you will use objects to create a mini banking application.

## Instructions

Update the `createMiniBank` function to achieve the following:

1. Add another private value of `statement` that should be set to an array with one value, `0`. This array will contain all transactions made with the MiniBank objects.

2. Add a `setBalance` function that takes a value and updates the private `statement` value to it.

3. Write an `updateStatement` function that takes in a number and pushes it to the `statement` array.

4. Write a `getStatement` function that returns the `statement` array.

5. Write a `printStatement` function that prints each element in the in the `statement` array on its own line.

6. Write a `deposit` function that takes a value and updates the `balance` value using the `setBalance` function.

7. Write a `withdraw` function that takes a value and subtracts it from the `balance`.

8. Return the `printBalance`, `printStatement`, `deposit`, `withdraw` functions from the `createMiniBank` function.

* Then, create a new `minibank` object using the `createMiniBank` function.

1. Print the `minibank` balance.

2. Deposit some money into the `minibank` object.

3. Print the `minibank` balance.

4. Withdraw some money from the `minibank` object.

5. Print the `minibank` balance.

## Bonus 🏆

* Add code to throw an error if the user tries to withdraw more money than they have, or try to deposit or withdraw values that aren't positive numbers.

* Add code to return a copy of the `statement` when `getStatement` is called, rather than returning the original array.
```

### 6. Instructor Do: Review Mini-Bank (10 mins)

* Open [03-Stu_Mini-Bank/Solved](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/03-Stu_Mini-Bank/Solved/minibank.js) in your IDE and point out the following points to students:

  * ✔️ We create a constructor function called `MiniBank` that will take in one argument, the starting balance.

  ```js
  function MiniBank(balance) {
  ```

  * ✔️ We use `this.` notation to declare functions on our constructor so all objects created from this constructor have access to those methods.

  ```js
  this.getBalance = function() {
    return this.balance;
  },
  ```

  * ✔️ In our `deposit` function we first check to make sure the provided argument is a number, and the number is greater than 0. We then set our `newBalance` to be equal to our current balance plus the current given value of the deposit.

  ```js
  this.deposit = function(value) {
  if (typeof value !== "number" || value <= 0) {
    throw new Error("'value' must be a positive number!");
  }
  var newBalance = this.getBalance() + value;
  ```

  * After we have gotten our `newBalance` we invoke the `setBalance` function and `updateStatement()` function. Finally we console log the deposited value.

  ```js
  this.setBalance(newBalance);
    this.updateStatement(newBalance);
    console.log(`Deposited ${value}!`);
  },
  ```

  * To create our new mini bank via our constructor we invoke the constructor using the `new` keyword.

  ```js
  var bank = new MiniBank(0);
  ```

  * Now we can call any of the functions we coded into the constructor earlier.

  ```js
  bank.printBalance();
  bank.deposit(85);
  bank.printBalance();
  bank.withdraw(20);
  bank.printBalance();
  bank.printStatement();
  ```

  * Ask the class the following question(s):

    * ☝️ Any questions about this past activity?

    * 🙋 If there are no questions, move right into the next student activity.

### 7. Student Do: Weather Admin (10 mins)

* Direct students to the next activity located in [04-Stu_Weather-Admin/Unsolved](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/04-Stu_Weather-Admin/Unsolved).

```md
# Weather Admin

In this activity you will create a CLI based weather application that will give updates about the weather at the searched location.

## Instructions

* There are two ways to run this app: as a user or as an administrator. To run as admin, type `node CLI.js admin` To run as a user, type `node CLI.js user bob "los angeles, ca"`, where the user mode must provide a name and a location as additional arguments.

* Ideally, users can search for weather data about a location. Every time they search, the place and time get saved to a text file. So when the app is run as admin, the admin user can see a history of all searches.

* Unfortunately, this app is also broken. Try to run it as either a user or admin and fix the actual errors that appear in the console and then any "logic" errors that prevent the expected behavior.
```

### 8. Instructor Do: Review Weather Admin (10 mins)

* Open [04-Stu_Weather-Admin/Solved](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/04-Stu_Weather-Admin/Solved) in your IDE and point out the following to students:

  * Navigate to [04-Stu_Weather-Admin/Solved/UserSearch.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/04-Stu_Weather-Admin/Solved/UserSearch.js).

  * ✔️ First we require the npm package `weather-js`.

  ```js
  const weather = require("weather-js");
  ```

  * Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):
  
    * ☝️ How do we ensure an NPM package will be installed when a dev runs `npm i`?
  
    * 🙋 We use the `--save` argument when installing to add it to our `package.json`

  * ✔️ We create a constructor function called UserSearch that will take a `name` and `location` as arguments. It will also use `Date.now();` to get the current date. 

  ```js
  const UserSearch = function(name, location) {
  this.name = name;
  this.location = location;
  this.date = Date.now();
  ```

  * ✔️ Our constructor also has a method of `getWeather`.  It will make use of the `weather-js` search function to search for weather of a given location. Lastly, we export our `UserSearch` constructor.

  ```js
  this.getWeather = function() {
    weather.find({ search: this.location, degreeType: "F" }, function(err, result) {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
      console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
      });
    };
  };

  module.exports = UserSearch;
  ```

  * Navigate to [04-Stu_Weather-Admin/Solved/WeatherAdmin.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/04-Stu_Weather-Admin/Solved/WeatherAdmin.js).

  * ✔️ First we require all the pieces necessary. `fs` is the File System, allowing us to create, delete, or update files on a users local machine. `UserSearch` is our constructor function we exported from `UserSearch.js`. Finally, we import `moment`, an NPM package for dates and times.

  ```js
  var fs = require("fs");
  var UserSearch = require("./UserSearch");
  var moment = require("moment");
  ```

  * ✔️ We create a constructor function called `WeatherAdmin`. It is given a method of `getData` which will use the file system to read a `log.txt` file if it exists, and log that data to the console.

  ```js
  var WeatherAdmin = function() {
  this.getData = function() {
    fs.readFile("log.txt", "utf8", function(error, data) {
      console.log(data);
    });
  };
  ```

  * ✔️ `WeatherAdmin` also gets a method of `newUserSearch`. This method takes in two arguments, name and location, much like our `UserSearch` constructor. This is so we can pass those two arguments along into the `UserSearch` constructor, as this method will instantiate a new `UserSearch` object and save it to a variable of `newUserSearch`.

  ```js
  this.newUserSearch = function(name, location) {
    var newUserSearch = new UserSearch(name, location);
  ```

  * ✔️ We set our `logTxt` variable to equal a string we build that will display the name, location, and date of the search. We then call `moment` to get the date, and format it to `MM-DD-YYYY`.

  ```js
  var logTxt =
  "\nName: " +
  newUserSearch.name +
  " Location: " +
  newUserSearch.location +
  " Date: " +
  moment(newUserSearch.date).format("MM-DD-YYYY");
  ```

  * ✔️ We use the `fs.appendFile` method to append the current value of `logTxt` to our `log.txt` file.

  ```js
  fs.appendFile("log.txt", logTxt, function(err) {
    if (err) throw err;
  });
  ```

  * ✔️ Next we call the `getWeather` method on our `newUserSearch` object.

  ```js
  newUserSearch.getWeather();
  ```

  * ✔️ Finally we export our `WeatherAdmin` constructor.

  ```js
  module.exports = WeatherAdmin;
  ```

  * Navigate to [04-Stu_Weather-Admin/Solved/CLI.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/04-Stu_Weather-Admin/Solved/CLI.js)


  * ✔️ First we require our WeatherAdmin export from `WeatherAdmin.js`

  ```js
  const WeatherAdmin = require("./WeatherAdmin");
  ```

  * ✔️ We use `process.argv`, taking the 3rd argument to find out if the value is `admin` or `user`.

  ```js
  const loginType = process.argv[2];
  ```

  * ✔️ We also need `Users` to provide a name and location.

  ```js
  const userName = process.argv[3];
  const userLocation = process.argv[4];
  ```

  * ✔️ We create an instance of the `WeatherAdmin`. If they are running it as an `admin`, run the `getData` method. If they are not an `admin`, we will run `newUserSearch` passing the arguments from the command line.

  ```js
  const myAdmin = new WeatherAdmin();

  if (loginType === "admin") {
    myAdmin.getData();
  }
  else {
    myAdmin.newUserSearch(userName, userLocation);
  }
  ```

### 9. Instructor Do: Introduce Prototypes (10 mins)

* Open [05-Ins_Prototypes/prototype-demo.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/05-Ins_Prototypes/prototype-demo.js) in your IDE, and then open your browser and the Chrome Dev Tools. Copy and paste each code block into your dev tools and point out the following.

  * ✔️ We create an array, and console log it. Next, we call the `.forEach` and `.map` methods on it.

  ```js
  myArray = [2, 4, 6, 8];
  console.log(myArray);

  myArray.forEach((num) => console.log(num));

  myArray.map((x) => console.log(x * 2));
  ```

  * ✔️ Next we console log the string `Hello`. We then call `"Hello.toLowerCase"`

  ```js

  console.log("Hello");
  console.log("Hello".toLowerCase());

  console.log(1337);
  console.log((1337).toString());
  ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ☝️ Where did the `.toLowerCase` come from?

  * 🙋 While those two methods did not show up when we console logged our string, the prototype has these methods built in. Arrays, Objects, even primitives all have a prototype which they take their structure and methods from. Any of of these that you create will have the prototype methods available to it via the `.prototype.`. i.e., `Array.prototype.forEach()`

  * ✔️ We created a constructor function named `Movie`, which will take in two arguments, `title` and `releaseYear`.

  ```js
  function Movie(title, releaseYear) {
    this.title = title;
    this.releaseYear = releaseYear;
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ☝️ What if we wanted to add a method to our constructor later on in our code?

  * 🙋 We would add that method to the `Movie.prototype`.

  * ✔️ We declare the title of our method, which will be `logInfo`. We do so by typing `Movie.prototype.logInfo = function(){}`.

  ```js
  Movie.prototype.logInfo = function() {
    console.log(`${this.title} was released in ${this.releaseYear}`);
  };
  ```

  * ✔️ We are not able to add properties to constructors without doing so through the prototype. The below would not work.

  ```js
  Movie.logInfo = function() {
    console.log(`${this.title} was released in ${this.releaseYear}`);
  };
  Movie.actor = "Tom Hanks"
  ```

  * We can only add to our constructor via the object prototype. Now that we have added our method to the objects prototype, lets create a new object via the `new` keyword and our `Movie` constructor. Then, we can call our `logInfo` function with basic dot notation.

  ```js
  const theShining = new Movie("The Shining", 1980)
  theShining.logInfo();
  ```

  * Objects also have their own prototype methods built in. Even though our object was created via a constructor function, it still has access to all the built in object prototype methods.

  ```js
  console.log(theShining.hasOwnProperty('title'));
  console.log(theShining.hasOwnProperty('logInfo'));
  console.log(Movie.prototype.hasOwnProperty('logInfo'));
  ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ☝️ What does the Object Prototype allow us to do?

  * 🙋 It allows us to add properties to our constructor after its creation, without having to go back and modify the constructors code.

  * Use the discussion to transition to the next topic.

### 10. Student Do: RPG Prototype (10 mins)

* Direct students to the next activity, located in [06-Stu_RPG-Prototypes](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/06-Stu_RPG-Prototypes).

```md
# Character Creation with Prototypes

In this activity you will generate RPG characters using Objects and prototypes.

## Instructions

* Over the course of this activity you are going to be using constructors to create simplistic characters for use within a very basic Roleplaying Game (RPG)

* Each character created using your constructor should have the following properties:

  * Name: The character's name --> String

  * Profession: What the character does for a living --> String

  * Age: The character's age --> Number

  * Strength: Abstraction for how strong the character is --> Number

  * HitPoints (HP): Abstraction for how much health the character has --> Number

  * PrintStats: Function which prints all of a character's properties to the screen

  * Once you have created your constructor, create two new characters and print their properties to the screen

* Now add 3 methods onto it via the prototype.

  * IsAlive: Function which prints whether or not this character is alive by looking into their hitpoints and determining whether they are above or below zero.

  * Attack: Function which takes in a second character and subtracts this character's strength from their hitpoints.

  * LevelUp: Function which increases this character's Age by 1, their Strength by 5, and their HitPoints by 25.
```

### 11. Instructor Do: Review RPG (10 mins)

* Open [06-Stu_RPG-Prototypes/Solved/rpg-prototypes.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/06-Stu_RPG-Prototypes/Solved/rpg-prototypes.js) in your IDE and point out the following to students:

  * ✔️ We create a `Character` constructor that will take in 6 arguments. We assign those arguments to keys in our constructor.

  ```js
  function Character(name, profession, gender, age, strength, hitpoints) {
    this.name = name;
    this.profession = profession;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.age = age;
    this.strength = strength;
    this.hitpoints = hitpoints;
  }
  ```

  * ✔️ We add an `isAlive` function to our object prototype.

  ```js
  Character.prototype.isAlive = function() {
	if (this.hitpoints > 0) {
		console.log(this.name + " is still alive!");
		console.log("\n-------------\n");
		return true;
	}
    console.log(this.name + " has died!");
    return false;
  };
  ```

  * ✔️ We also add two other functions to our `prototype`. The `attack` method takes in a second object and decreases their "hitpoints" by this character's strength. The `levelUp` method increases `this` character's stats when called.

  ```js
  Character.prototype.attack = function(character2) {
    character2.hitpoints -= this.strength;
  };

  Character.prototype.levelUp = function() {
    this.age += 1;
    this.strength += 5;
    this.hitpoints += 25;
  };
  ```

  * ✔️ Finally we can use our constructor to create two characters, calling their methods from the prototype that we added.

  ```js
  var warrior = new Character("Crusher", "Warrior", "Male", 25, 10, 75);
  var rogue = new Character("Dodger", "Rogue", "Female", 23, 20, 50);

  warrior.printStats();
  rogue.printStats();

  rogue.attack(warrior);
  warrior.printStats();
  warrior.isAlive();

  rogue.levelUp();
  rogue.printStats();
  ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ☝️ What is a major benefit of using constructor functions?

  * 🙋 They allow us to create a single blueprint for objects we would like to create later. This saves us time, memory, and work. 

  * Use the discussion to transition to the final activity of the day.

### 12. Student Do: Tamagotchi App (10 mins)

* Direct students to the final activity, located in [07-Stu_Tamagotchi](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/07-Stu_Tamagotchi).

```md
# **Instructions**

* Remember Tamagotchis? They were those little toys that contained "digital pets" which you could feed, pet, play with, and care for. Kind of like Furbies but a whole lot less terrifying. Over the next thirty minutes or so, you are going to create your own basic Tamagotchi clone using constructors.

* Create a constructor called "DigitalPal" which will create four properties and four methods...

  * The first property is "hungry" and it initially starts out as false

  * The second property is "sleepy" and it initially starts out as false

  * The third property is "bored" and it initially starts out as true

  * The fourth property is "age" and it initially starts out at 0

* The first method is "feed()" - If hungry is true, print "That was yummy!", set hungry to false, and then set sleepy to true. If hungry is false, print "No thanks! I'm full."

* The second method is "sleep()" - If sleepy is true, print `Zzzzzzzz`, set sleepy to false, then set bored to true, and then run increaseAge(). If sleepy is false, print "No way! I'm not tired."

* The third method is "play()" - If bored is true, print "Yay! Let's play!", set bored to false, and then set hungry to true. If bored is false, print "Not right now. Later?"

* The fourth method is "increaseAge()" - This method is called by the sleep() method when the DigitalPal goes to sleep and increases the DigitalPal's age by one while also printing "Happy Birthday to me! I am "+age+" old!"

* Create a variable named "dog" that is set to a new DigitalPal before adding the following unique properties/methods to it...

  * outside - Initially set to false

  * bark() - Prints out "Woof! Woof!" when run

  * goOutside() - If outside is false, prints "Yay! I love the outdoors!", sets outside to true, and runs bark(). If outside is true, prints "We're already outside though..."

  * goInside() - If outside is true, prints "Do we have to? Fine..." and sets outside to false. If outside is false, prints "I'm already inside..."

* Make a second variable named "cat" that is set to a new DigitalPal and add the following methods to it:

  * houseCondition - Initially set to 100... But not for long...

  * meow() - prints out "Meow! Meow!" when run

  * destroyFurniture() - Decreases houseCondition by 10 and prints "MUAHAHAHAHA! TAKE THAT FURNITURE!" to the screen. Also sets bored to false and sleepy to true. If houseCondition is equal to 0, then this should not run anymore.

  * buyNewFurniture() - Increases houseCondition by 50 and prints "Are you sure about that?" to the screen.

* Play around with your newly created digital pets for a bit and see what else you could add in order to make them even more exciting!

* BONUS: Make it so your Tamagotchis run off of user-input from the command line. It may sound easy at first, but this can actually be quite challenging. We will be going over this in more detail during the next class.

### 13. Instructor Do: Review Tamagotchi (10 mins)

* Open [07-Stu_Tamagotchi/Solved/tamagotchi.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/07-Stu_Tamagotchi/Solved/tamagotchi.js) in your IDE and point out the following to students:

  * ✔️ We first create a constructor function named `DigitalPal`. It takes no arguments as the value of the keys are predefined.
  
  ```js
  var DigitalPal = function() {
    this.hungry = false;
    this.sleepy = false;
    this.bored = true;
    this.age = 0;
  };
  ```

  * We create a function `feed` and attach it to the `.prototype.`. The method `feeds` the DigitalPal when they are hungry and sets them to sleepy

  ```js
  DigitalPal.prototype.feed = function() {
    if (this.hungry) {
      console.log("That was yummy!");
      this.hungry = false;
      this.sleepy = true;
    } else {
      console.log("No thanks, I'm full.");
    }
  };
  ```

  * We create a method called `sleep`, which puts the DigitalPal to sleep when they are sleepy. It also invokes the `increaseAge` function.

  ```js
  DigitalPal.prototype.sleep = function() {
    if (this.sleepy) {
      console.log("ZZzzZZZzzZZz~~");
      this.sleepy = false;
      this.bored = true;
      this.increaseAge();
    }
    else {
      console.log("No way! I'm not tired!");
    }
  };
  ```

  * We create a method called `play` which allows the user to play with their DigitalPal when they are bored and sets hungry to `true` and bored to `false.`

  ```js
  DigitalPal.prototype.play = function() {
    if (this.bored) {
      console.log("Yay! Let's play!");
      this.bored = false;
      this.hungry = true;
    }
    else {
      console.log("Not right now. Maybe later?");
    }
  };
  ```

  * This is the `increaseAge` method which is called within our `sleep` method. It will increase the age of our DigitalPal by one.

  ```js
  DigitalPal.prototype.increaseAge = function() {
    this.age++;
    console.log("Happy Birthday to me! I am " + this.age + " old!");
  };
  ```

  * We create a new animals object to hold our new DigitalPals

  ```js
  var animals = {};
  ```

  * We create a new DigitalPal object with the name "dog"

  ```js
  animals.dog = new DigitalPal();
  ```

  * We add the property `outside` to the `dog` object and set it to `false`. We also create the method `bark` and attach it to the `dog` object which logs a method to our console.

  ```js
  animals.dog.outside = false;
  animals.dog.bark = function() {
    console.log("Woof! Woof!");
  ```

  * We create and attach a `letOutside` method to the dog object, which will let our dog outside when invoked.

  ```js
  animals.dog.letOutside = function() {
    if (!this.outside) {
      console.log("Yay! I love the outdoors!");
      this.outside = true;
      this.bark();
    }
    else {
      console.log("We're already outside though...");
    }
  };
  ```

  * We create and attach a `letInside` method to the `dog` object which lets `dog` inside when it is outside.

  ```js
  animals.dog.letInside = function() {
    if (this.outside) {
      console.log("Aww... Do I have to?");
      this.outside = false;
    }
    else {
      console.log("We're already inside though...");
    }
  };
  ```

  * We go through a similar process with create a `cat` object, and providing it with specific `cat` like methods.

  ```js
  animals.cat = new DigitalPal();
  animals.cat.houseQuality = 100;

  animals.cat.meow = function() {
    console.log("Meow! Meow!");
  };

  animals.cat.destroyFurniture = function() {
    if (this.houseQuality - 10 > 0) {
      this.houseQuality -= 10;
      this.bored = false;
      this.sleepy = true;
      console.log("MUAHAHAHAHA! TAKE THAT FURNITURE!");
    }
    else {
      console.log("I've already destroyed it all!");
    }
  };

  animals.cat.buyNewFurniture = function() {
    this.houseQuality += 50;
    console.log("Are you sure that's a good idea?");
  };
  ```

  * Finally we can grab the command line arguments provided by the user and use store them in variables called `animal` and `method`.

  ```js
  var animal = process.argv[2];
  var method = process.argv[3];
  ```
