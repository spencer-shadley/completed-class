# 15.1 Lesson Plan - Linting, Travis, and Project 2 (6:30 PM)

## Overview

* Today's class will be focused on introducing students to project 2 requirements, introducing them to the concept of JavaScript linting and continuous integration with Travis.

* Students will begin work on their second project

## Instructor Notes

`Complete activities 1-4 in Unit 15`

* Praise students for making it to their second group projects.

* Leverage the TAs to help any groups lagging behind during the lesson. We want to give students as much time to brainstorm project ideas as possible.

* Instructors / TAs, take a few moments before class to review the presentations posted on this link: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe80S_8KApqOTw-2-b-sgzTwwWImepoii>. Do not share these with students as they are Rutgers Specific &mdash; however, use the insight you gain in watching these videos to understand what's possible.

## Learning Objectives

* Project groups will create a project repo and add members as collaborators.

* Students will have a project set up with linting and using Travis CI.

* Students will submit a project proposal (ideas, outlines, APIs) by end of class for feedback.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Students (5 min)

* Welcome students and explain that as we enter project # 2, we're going to start thinking a little more about _code quality_. Today we'll cover using a JavaScript linter and Travis CI checks to achieve this.

* Explain that later this week we'll also cover the basics of agile development and testing web applications. 

* Assure the class that they'll have plenty of time to brainstorm project ideas before submitting their proposals for review by the end of class.

* Students should sit with their groups during today's activities and work to follow along with the examples.

### 2. Instructor Do: Project 2 Slides (10 min)

* Go through the slide deck [15-1 Linting and Projects](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DldswLqfUbnvidzyMLhmZUwYpwy_CXI0WPx5pMUuDZo/edit?usp=sharing).

* Slack out the [requirements for project 2](../Project-Resources/README.md).

* Let students know about the [starter code for project 2](../../../../01-Class-Content/14-Full-Stack/0-Supplemental/Sequelize-Passport-Example).

* Answer any questions about project requirements.

### 3. Groups Do: Create a Repository (10 mins)

* Have students sit with their project groups as they create a new project repository. Then have them invite each other as collaborators.

* We have created a written guide and video guide on how to connect a GitHub repository to a Heroku Application for continuous deployment. Please provide these to your students along with the following activity instructions.

    [Connect Repo with Heroku Guide](../../../../01-Class-Content/15-Project-2/04-Supplemental/GitHubHerokuConnect.md)

    [Connect Repo with Heroku Video](https://youtu.be/GgNcs9zlFSA?list=PLOFmg4xbN_TPrB6w4rThsFanVxJI_SfER)

* Refer to `15-Project-2/01-Activities/01-Stu_Create-Repository`, which contains the following instructions:

* **Instructions**:

```
* One group member should create a new Github repo for the project.

* Protect the repo's master branch as we did during project 1.

  * Once at the repo's page, click the "Settings" tab.

  * Select "Branches" from the left sidebar.

  * Under "Branch protection rules", choose "master" from the dropdown.

  * Check off the following options:

    * "Protect this branch"

    * "Require pull request reviews before merging"

    * "Include administrators"

    * "Require status checks to pass before merging"

    * "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
  
  * Click "Save changes"

* Once complete, invite the other group members as collaborators.

* Upon creation of your repository, we would like you and your group to then create a Heroku application and connect your GitHub Repository for automatic deployment.

  * We have created a written guide and video guide on how you can link your GitHub Repo to your Heroku Application for continuous deployment which your instructor will provide.

* Once connection is complete, link your Heroku Applications live link to your TAs.
```

### 4. Instructor Do: Linting Slides + Overview (5 mins)

* Use the slide deck [16-1 Linting and Projects](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DldswLqfUbnvidzyMLhmZUwYpwy_CXI0WPx5pMUuDZo/edit?usp=sharing), starting with the "Linting" slide, as you go through this section.

* Explain that now we'll discuss linting code with JavaScript.

  * Ask the class: "Can anyone tell me what a JavaScript linter is? Or why we would use one?"

    * A linter is a tool that we can use to analyze our code for potential errors as we're writing it. Linters can also be used to enforce particular styles of coding based on rules we can turn on or off.

    * Linters are useful because they can help teams write more consistent and readable code according to what they consider to be best practices. They're also helpful for identifying potential errors before the code is even run, thus improving overall code quality.

* Exposing students to linting will help during group projects and beyond as most software development teams use some kind of linter to maintain readable and consistent code quality.

* Explain that there are a few different libraries available for linting JavaScript code, but the one we'll be working with is the most popular: [eslint](https://eslint.org/).

* Take a moment to answer any high-level questions about linting, but avoid getting too off track as students will see how eslint works for themselves in the next activity.

### 5. Partners Do: No Lint Example (5 mins)

* In this activity students will examine a JavaScript file without eslint and attempt to identify issues with the code.

* Refer to `15-Project-2/01-Activities/02-Stu_No-Lint-Example`, which contains the following instructions:

* **Instructions**:

```
* Before looking at any code, open Unsolved/index.html in your web browser and study the rendered application.

  * This simple example prompts the user for 2 numbers, and then what sort of mathematical operation they would like to perform. The result is then alerted back to the user.

* Now open Unsolved/example.js in your editor.

  * For what this application is supposed to do, the code works perfectly.

* Discuss with your partner: Even though the code works, what's wrong with it?
```

### 6. Instructor Do: Review No Lint Example (5 mins)

* As a class, go over the previous activity's [solution](../../../../01-Class-Content/15-Project-2/01-Activities/02-Stu_No-Lint-Example/Solved/README.md) comparing each point to parts of the code being referred to.

* Explain that while none of these are actual JavaScript errors, consistency is important because it makes code easier to understand, especially if working on a team with others. Additionally having a linter helps ensure code reviews aren't just nitpicks over stylistic opinions.

* Take a moment to answer any questions but inform the class that in the next activity we'll fix the project using eslint.

### 7. Partners Do: Eslint Example (5 mins)

* In this activity students will use eslint to fix issues with the calculator app from the previous activity.

* Refer to `15-Project-2/01-Activities/03-Stu_Eslint-Example`, which contains the following instructions:

* **Instructions**:

```
* Install the [VS Code Eslint Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

* Open the Unsolved folder and run `npm install` from your terminal to install dependencies.

* Now open Unsolved/example.js in your code editor. If you were able to complete the previous steps correctly, you should see red annotations under different parts of the code. Hovering over each displays a popover with an eslint rule being broken.

* Work to fix each part of the annotated code.

* **Bonus**:

* Try changing the quote style to enforce single-quotes instead of double-quotes.

* **Hints**:

* If you're unsure about what an eslint rule is asking for, type it into Google for examples.
```

### 8. Instructor Do: Review Eslint Example (5 mins)

* Demonstrate how hovering over the annotations in the `example.js` file brings up the eslint rule being broken in the file.

  ![Eslint Annotations](Images/01-Eslint-Annotations.png)

* Explain that eslint is an npm package that must be installed. The VS Code extension gives us the annotations over our files so we know what to fix in the moment, but only works if we have the eslint npm package installed.

* Additionally eslint provides a cli tool we can use. Run the following command in your terminal to demonstrate this:

  ```
  npm run lint
  ```

* If you haven't already gone ahead and fixed all the lint errors in the `example.js` file, you should receive errors in the console. Scroll up to see the specific eslint errors and their line numbers.

* Ask the class: "Where do you think the the eslint rules are being set?

  * The `.eslintrc.json` file.

* Demonstrate the `.eslintrc.json` file for the class. Explain that this file contains the rules we want eslint to enforce for us. A list of eslint rules and how to use them can be found at [eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

  * Eslint also includes the ability to share configs. Companies like Google and AirBnB create and publicly share their own configurations based on style guides used at their companies.

  * Students can look into how to use these if they wish, but they may find them to be much more restrictive than the simple one we're using now.

* Stress that changing conventions used in a project is now as easy as changing an eslint config. If the team decide they would prefer to indent 4 spaces instead of 4 or would prefer single quotes over double quotes, all we need to do is change a rule in the eslint config.

  * Being able to do this so easily helps us stay productive and minimize distractions. Without a linter, getting the entire team on board with and using a new convention could be a much more tedious and stressful process.

* Suggest that students use at least the basic eslint config provided for them in their projects. Take a moment to answer any additional questions.

### 9. Instructor Do: Introduce Travis CI Slides (5 mins)

* Explain to the class that linters aren't very helpful if some group members choose to ignore their rules.

* Explain that in the next activity we're going to set up Travis CI (Continuous Integration).

  * Travis will prevent any code from being merged into master that doesn't pass the linter.

  * Travis will run a check on any new branches PR'd against master. This check may take a minute, but you will only be allowed to merge the code if the lint passes. Otherwise whoever made the PR will have to fix their code and try again.

* Take a moment to answer any questions. Students will follow step-by-step instructions to add Travis to their repos in the next activity.

### 10. Students Do: Travis Setup (10 mins)

* In this activity students will add Travis CI to their projects.

* Instructional staff should be walking around answering questions and making sure groups can complete the activity.

* Refer to `15-Project-2/01-Activities/04-Travis-Setup`, which contains the following instructions:

* **Instructions**:

```
* Only the owner of the project repo should complete this activity, other group members should watch.

* **Part 1**: Protecting Master

* Before we can set up Travis, we must configure the project repo to protect the master branch.

* Navigate to the repo's page, then click the "Settings" tab.

* Select "Branches" from the left sidebar.

* Under "Branch protection rules", choose "master" from the drop-down.

* Check off the following options:

  * "Protect this branch"

  * "Require pull request reviews before merging"

  * "Include administrators"

  * "Require status checks to pass before merging"

  * "Require branches to be up to date before merging"

* Click "Save changes"

* **Part 2**: Add Travis

* Navigate to <https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci>.

* Select the option to "Set up a new plan" and choose the $0 "Open Source" plan when prompted.

* Click "Install it for free" and then on the next page click "Complete order and begin installation".

* On the next page select the radio button that reads "Only select repositories".

* From the "Select repositories" drop-down, choose your project repo.

* Click the "Install" button to complete the process.
```

* Take some time to answer any lingering questions about Travis CI. Be sure to emphasize that students do not need to know the ins and outs of Travis to slowly begin integrating its build capabilities into their projects.
