### Statement of completion

If the student completed both the easier assignment and the recommended assignment, please provide the letter grade for the recommended assignment and leave short commentary for each, including a note of encouragement for attempting or completing both. 

Be subjective, grading & feedback should not take more than 5 minutes per assignment.

**Repository Naming**

* It will be enticing and easy for students to name their homework something like Unit X Homework, Week X Homework, or Homework X. This has been discouraged in their homework instructions and any repositories without a more unique name should receive an `I` until the name is changed.

**Criteria**

The deployed assignment utilizes jQuery to show the user a random number, and give each crystal a value. When the user clicks on a crystal, it adds the value to a number for the user. If the user's number is below the random number, the game keeps going. If the user's number is exactly the random number, the user wins. If the user's number goes over the random number, the user loses. The deployed assignment has been added to their deployed portfolio with a link provided in the submission.

**Is the above statement correct?**

1. **Yes**: Grade will be an A or a B

2. **No**: Grade will be a C

3. **No idea, can't test**: Grade will be a D or an  F

4. **Empty Repository**: Grade will be an I

### Yes (A or B)

If the student's assignment was pristine, give them an A, and an encouraging sentence for feedback.

If the student's assignment had a few areas for improvement, give them a B, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback.

### Yes (B or C)

If the student does not complete the assignment, but they have solid and well written pseudocode, give them a B. If they have incomplete pseudocode or its poorly written, give them a C.

### No (C)

Give the student a C, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback. Invite the student to office hours to go over topics not mastered.

### No idea (D or F)

If the project isn't deployed, the student receives a D.

If the student submitted a homework but nothing works or functions, the student receives an F.

Either way, explain to the student why they received that grade and invite them to visit office hours for help.

### Empty Repository (I)

Students should receive this grade **only** if they submit an empty repository. If the student attempted the homework assignment and was simply unable to get it fully functioning, they should still receive a normal letter grade, not an 'Incomplete'.
