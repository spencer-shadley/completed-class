# Unit 17: NoSQL

## Overview

In this unit, we will be introducing students to the NoSQL database with MongoDB and Mongoose. We'll also be showing students how to store data in IndexedDB.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/17-NoSQL/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* Before class, make sure you install MongoDB and Robo 3T on your machine. 

* Note that students with MacOS running Catalina may need to use brew tap to install mongodb. [Blog post about MongoDB's Brew Tap](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodbs-official-brew-tap-now-open-and-flowing)

* When working with IndexedDB, make sure you refresh and or delete your database in IndexedDB in between activities.

## Heads Up

* In the next unit, we will spend a lot of time practicing performance optimizing techniques. This should serve as a transition into the React unit. If necessary, replace some activities in the next unit with review/skipped activities from this unit.
