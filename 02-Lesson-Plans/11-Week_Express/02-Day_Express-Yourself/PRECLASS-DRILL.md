### Pre-class Drill

* Let students know that it's time for the preclass drill of the day. Remind them that interviewing is a skill that is in some ways separate from practical coding, and that they need to work hard to hone this skillset during this course. The class is designed to make them great developers, and these pre-class questions are designed to make them awesome interviewers.

* Encourage students to begin by pseudo-coding. Remind them that many companies are judging more on problem solving skills than coding chops, so having strong pseudo-coding skills to fall back on may just land them their dream job one day. You should encourage some white boarding from students (when relevant) and explain why it's beneficial for them to do it in the classroom rather than wait for their first time to be during interviews, but move on if there are no volunteers. Discourage heavy pressure for students.

* 20 min before class starts write the following problem on the board or Slack it out:

```
What is a JavaScript Prototype?
```

* Remind students that there are multiple kinds of interview questions. We've largely practiced coding problems, but they should expect to encounter discussion problems as well.

* If your class hasn't discussed prototypes, encourage students to Google this one. Ask that they not copy a definition but instead read several articles and come up with their own definition. 
 
* After 15 minutes take 5 minutes to go over the solution. You should start recording when going over the answer and Slack out the answer at the end of office hours before class starts.

* Ask students if they found a solution and go over their solution (or the ones below if no student-solution is provided). 

* Be sure to praise students who provide a solution even if it isn't fully correct. 

* Ensure the following points are hit:

  * Prototypes hold properties and methods that _all_ objects of that type can access.

  * For example, the Array prototype has the `push`, `map`, `any`,  `filter`, and `includes` methods. That's why every array can use those methods.

  * The prototype can be thought of as a centralized storage place for functionality that all objects of a type share access to.
