# 6.3 - Real-World API Application Development

## Learning Objectives

- To further build mastery of dynamic element generation and AJAX calls

- To provide "real-world" application development scenario that requires collaborative coding

### Instructor Do: Congratulatory Monologue on Full-Stack

- 1000-05 (5 min)

* Take a few moments at the start of class to offer students a few congratulatory words. They've undergone over 6 weeks of grueling (and often frustrating) work -- and are probably feeling a bit burnt out. Re-invigorate them! Let them know that the rate of their progress is astounding! And that they've learned in just a few short weeks what a self-taught developer might have taken months to learn.

* Give students a few moments to ask questions. Encourage them to ask questions about anything -- code, career, anxiety. Build a rapport here!

* Once you've taken a few minutes, open up [nytarticle-search-fsf.herokuapp.com](https://nytarticle-search-fsf.herokuapp.com/) in the browser and show them what they'll be building later today.

* Ask if any students are history buffs -- then ask them to give you a historic figure and the year in which they were around. Type in their name and a year-range to then pull up New York Times articles about the figure.

### Partners Do: 12-CatButton

- 1005-15 (10 min)

- click image to add a gif of a cat

### Instructor Do: Review 12-CatButton

- 1015-25 (10 min)

### Partners Do: 13-ButtonTriggeredAJAX

- 1025-40 (15 min)

- shows buttons of quotes, clicking buttons gets 10 gifs by the author of that quote

### Instructor Do: Review 13-ButtonTriggeredAJAX

- 1040-45 (5 min)

  - Point out that the solution was much simpler than some may have thought. We basically created buttons with text inside. The key distinction here is that we used a data-attribute with the author's name. Point out that we later used the JavaScript method `$(this).attr('data-person')` to retrieve the data inside the data-attribute. Confirm that students understand this!

### Partners Do: 14-DynamicElements

- 1045-11 (15 min)

* Allows you to trigger gifs about animals

### Instructor Do: Review 14-DynamicElements

- 11-05 (5 min)

* Call on students to explain each line of the code back to you

### Everyone Do: Reiterate Concepts

- 1105-15 (10 min)

* Spend a few moments re-iterating the high-level concepts we've been discussing in class.

  - What is an API?

  - What does API stand for? (// Application Programming Interface )

  - What are three use-cases for APIs?

    - Communication (retrieve data)

    - Utilize external snippets of code

    - Work with hardware / physical sensors

  - What does JSON stand for? (// JavaScript Object Notation)

  - What is JSON?

  - What is the jQuery method we've been using to retrieve data from online sources? (// AJAX)

  - Are AJAX requests synchronous or asynchronous? Why?

### Partners Do: 15-PausingGifs

- 1115-30 (15 min)

* start and pause the animation of each gif you click

### Instructor Do: Review 15-PausingGifs

- 1130-35 (5 min)

* During your discussion, be sure to point out the following:

  - That we are flipping `data-state` as though it were a toggle -- switching it on and off between `animate` and `still` whenever a click occurs.

### Instructor Do: 16-NYTSearch

- 1135-40 (5 min)

* Break students into groups. Before going on break, have students sign up for a New York Times API key via the following url: <https://developer.nytimes.com/signup>. It only takes a minute to sign up, but can take up to 10 minutes for a registered API key to be emailed, so it's best to take care of this before going on break.

### BREAK

- 1140-1220 (40 min)

### Students Do: 16-NYTSearch

- 1220-25 (5 min)

* Re-introduce the NYT Article Search Application by visiting this link [nytarticle-search-fsf.herokuapp.com](https://nytarticle-search-fsf.herokuapp.com/).

* Re-walk students through the high points of the application -- namely that it allows you to search the [New York Times Article API](http://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json).

* Then offer students the following commentary:

  - This is a **hard** activity to do completely right.

  - It will require you to code quickly, efficiently divide tasks, and deal with bugs in retrospect.

  - It's also a really great activity for gaining mastery.

  - Let them know that they should be partnering in sub-pairs. With one pair working on the user interface and the second pair working on API calls.

  - Let them know that they should take honest stock of their abilities and focus on what they feel comfortable doing.

  - Explain to students that a specific developer (or team of developers) is often designated to work on a specific feature. When working as separate teams they need to learn to communicate needs and expectations with other developers working on related features (i.e. data teams should expect text inputs from the UI team)

### Students Do: 16-NYTSearch (Phase I)

- 1225-55 (30 min)

- Design and API

### Students Do: 16-NYTSearch (Phase II)

- 1255-125 (30 min)

- Coding the logic

* After time, let students know that they should be entering the second phase (Code Logic).

* Let them know that during this phase, they will likely need to work more closely together across teams.

### Students Do: 16-NYTSearch (Phase III)

- 125-55 (30 min)

* After time, let students know that they should ideally be working on bug handling.

### Students Do: 16-NYTSearch (Phase IV)

- 155-205 (10 min)

* After the last phase is complete, let students know that it's time to clean-up their apps and deploy them.

### Students Do: 16-NYTSearch Review

- 205-15 (10 min)

* Spend a few moments going around the room and having each group share at least ONE lesson they learned doing today's exercise.

* Recap the event by explaining that today's activity should have showed you that:

  - APIs are harder to use than you might expect

  - Working in separate teams requires careful coordination and

  - Working in teams can allow you to create cleaner code (as more eyes are fixing the same bugs).
