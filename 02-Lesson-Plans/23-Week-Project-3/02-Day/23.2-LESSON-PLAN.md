## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Peer Recommendations (5 min)

* Explain to students that LinkedIn recommendations from peers and coworkers are a key way to lend credibility to their profiles.

* It's important that the recommendation be genuine and specific.

* **Slack** out this sample recommendation:

  * I worked with Amy on the “Developers Without Borders” project. I can't overstate how vital she was to the team's success. She single-handedly built the virtual community, creating the tools and policies to facilitate coordination between a group of developers spread around the globe. She's a strong javascript developer who picks up new technologies as rapidly as you can throw them at her. Behind a strong analytical mindset lays a creative and very human-oriented soul which made Amy a great colleague to work with. Her approach to problem solving makes her someone who will push the envelope, go beyond status quo, and seek for creative solutions even when faced with complex issues.
