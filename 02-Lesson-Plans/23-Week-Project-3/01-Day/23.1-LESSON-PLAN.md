## Instructor Notes

- Students' portfolio assignment in bootcampspot will contain requirements & guidance to get students started.

- Defer to CDs when it comes to advice on items like Resumes or Linkedin presence. We want to ensure that we are presenting students with a consistent message.

- As Instructors / TAs, keep in mind that the success of your students post-bootcamp is largely dictated by the quality of their final projects and portfolios. Encourage and help steer them in every way you can towards high-quality production!
