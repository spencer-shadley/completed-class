## 3.2 Lesson Plan - Jumping for JavaScript (6:30 PM)

## Overview

Today's class is focused on introducing students to the concept of `for` loops and of how they can be used in combination with arrays, if/else statements, and other common programming tools to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

`Summary: Complete Activities 14-24 in Unit 03`

## Instructor Notes

* In today's class you will be covering the concept of `for` loops and subsequently, the concept of combining arrays, conditionals, `for` loops, and user inputs to create more sophisticated JavaScript applications. Much of what students have learned to date will culminate in the last activity of the day where they will work together to build a rock-paper-scissors game.

* Today's lesson plan is packed to the brim with activities. Realistically assess your usual pace; if you are an instructor who tends to fall behind, skip activities which say "TIME PERMITTING" on the slides. If you tend to speak and present at a fast pace, take the time to complete as many of these exercises as you like. Alternatively, you can always just show students the solutions to these activities in live demos, and then Slack them the answers. Just BE SURE to leave around 1 hour of class time for students to work on the rock-paper-scissors activity. This activity is extremely important, and it's a close match to their homework assignment.

* Students should be given a substantial amount of time to complete the rock-paper-scissors activity. They will not have been given everything they need to complete the activity. The idea is for students to become more comfortable with the idea of working without knowing _everything_. Reveal bits of the solution using the code in the `23-RPS-Coded` directory while students are working. Throughout class, show these bits of the solution on the projector, and try to help guide students through the problem.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Define the syntax and uses of a `for` loop.

* Demonstrate how to use a `for` loop.

* Utilize conditional logic within their functions

* Construct a rock paper scissors game utilizing `for` loops, arrays, and conditional logic.

* To understand the use and syntax of JavaScript's `for` loops.

* To use `for` loops, arrays, and conditional logic to create a rock-paper-scissors game.

* Always call on individual students as you go through the slides.

### 4. Everyone Do: Basic JS Dissection (3 mins)

* Slack out the following file from yesterday and have students re-examine it.

* Give them a few minutes to examine it, and immediately have a few students explain it to the class.

  * **File**

    * `js-dissect-unsolved.html`in `14-JSDissect/Unsolved/`

  * **Instructions**

    * Take a few minutes to quickly look through the attached file. With a partner, discuss what you expect to happen when the code is run.

    * Prepare to share your thoughts with the class.

* After you go over the activity, if there are still questions, Slack out the fully commented file `js-dissect-solved.html` in `14-JSDissect/Solved`.

### 5. Everyone Do: Array Logging (5 mins)

* Slack out the file and the instructions below.

* Read the instructions aloud, and call on students to help you live-code the activity.

  * **File**

    * `array-logs-unsolved.html` in `15-CoolPeopleArray/Unsolved`

  * **Instructions**

    * Follow the instructions provided in the file to `console.log` each of the names in the `coolPeople` variable.

    * Hint: You should be repeating the same line 6 times.

### 12. BREAK (15 mins)

* Touch base with TAs regarding pace at this point in time. Decide what assignments you can and cannot include so that students have at least one hour to work on the rock-paper-scissors assignment.

- - -

### 13. Students Do: Another Loop (Optional) (0 mins)

* If you are AHEAD of schedule and feel like students could benefit from another example, Slack out the following instructions.

  * **Instructions**

    * Starting from scratch, create a `for` loop that console logs the following lines:
      ```
      I am 0
      I am 1
      I am 2
      I am 3
      I am 4
      ```
    * Don't use an array!

### 14. Instructor Do: Review Activity (Optional) (0 mins)

* Review `another-loop-solved.html` in `19-AnotherLoop/Solution`.

  * Point out that in this case, the iterator is not an array length but an integer.

  * Point out that the length is **one less than** the final number desired.

      ![/Images/6-AnotherLoop.png](Images/6-AnotherLoop.png)

* Then Slack out `another-loop-solved.html`

### 15. Partners Do: Loop with Conditions (10 mins)

* **Instructions**

  * Starting from scratch, write code that loops through the following array and that logs the name of each animal on the farm to the console:

    ```
    var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];
    ```

  * Then check if the first letter in the animal's name begins with a "c" or "o." If it does, create an alert saying, "Starts with 'c' or 'o'!"

  * **Hint**: You can access the first character of a string as if it were the first element of an array.

### 16. Instructor Do: Review Activity (5 mins)

* Review `hard-loop.html` in `20-HardLoop/Solution`.

    ![/Images/7-HardLoop.png](Images/7-HardLoop.png)

### 17. Students Do: Random Number Loop (7 mins) (Critical)

* Slack out the following file and instructions to students.

  * **File**:

    * `random-numbers-unsolved.html` in `21-RandomNumbers/Unsolved`

  * **Instructions**:

    * Research how to improve on `Math.random()` to generate a random whole number between 1 and 10 instead of a random decimal number.

* Before they get started on the activity, briefly explain that we're using a built-in JavaScript feature called `Math.random()` to print 10 random numbers, but the numbers are all decimals. Prompt students to do some Googling to change this to print 10 random _whole_ numbers. It shouldn't take long for them to find the answer.

### 18. Instructor Do: Review Random Numbers (3 mins) (Critical)

* Have a student share what they found. If you're running short on time, or no one has an answer, open the solution at [random-numbers-solved.html](../../../../01-Class-Content/03-javascript/01-Activities/21-RandomNumbers/Solved/random-numbers-solved.html) in `21-RandomNumbers/Solution`

* Point out that we added a few more things around the random function: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1`

* If you have time, explain that multiplying `Math.random()` by 10 will now give us a random number between 0 and 9.999. We're still getting a decimal, though, so we use `Math.floor()` to round down. But now we're only getting a random number between 0 and 9, so we'll always add 1 to bump it up to 1-10.

* If time is short, simply state that this is a common solution when needing random whole numbers, and the more students see and use this syntax, the more it will make sense to them.

### 19. Instructor Do: Demo RPS (2 mins)

* Take a couple of minutes to demonstrate the final application `23-RPS-Coded`.

* Be brief. Show students what they'll be building, but don't fiddle with the app for more than a minute.

* Explain that the core logic of the application is the decision as to which player wins, based on whether they've played rock, paper, or scissors.

  * Remind students that they'll need to use conditional statements and the `&&`/`||` operators to make things work.

  * Remind students that it's okay if they have to write a long chain of `if`/`else if`/`else` statements. If they find themselves doing this, they're on the right track.

  * Emphasize that the computer _randomly_ chooses each time.

* Take an extra few minutes here if necessary to make sure everyone understands the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors (it's not uncommon for a few students to have never played as it's not universally popular around the world.)

### 20. Students Do: Pseudocode RPS (3 mins)

* Once they've played a few rounds, have them create a pseudocoded solution that lays out the steps involved in playing rock-paper-scissors against a computer.

* Slack out the following instructions.

  * **Instructions**

    * With a partner, spend a few moments outlining all the steps and conditions that go into a single game of rock paper scissors.

    * Try to break it down into steps that you could code out.

    * Think of basic elements like loops, if-else statements, arrays, alerts, etc.

    * Be prepared to share your outlined approach.

* **Instructor Note:** When time is up, show `pseudocode-rps.md` in `22-PseudoCode/Solution`.

* Encourage students to use this pseudocode as a starting point or as a guide with which to finish their own sketch of the application.

### 21. Partners Do: Coding out RPS (60 mins) (Critical)

* Slack out the following instructions to students.

  * **Instructions**:

    * In groups of 4, begin the process of coding out the rock-paper-scissors game.

    * Have users play the game 10 times, then show them their total scores.

    * Do as much as you can on your own, but don't be afraid to ask for help if you feel your team is struggling.

    * **Note**: Don’t worry. We know this is a very challenging assignment. We also know that you won’t know where to start. In fact, we haven’t shown you EVERYTHING you need yet, but that’s okay. Part of being a developer is figuring things out on your own through trial and error.

### 22. Instructor Do: Review RPS (10 mins) (Critical)

* Open [rps-6.html](../../../../01-Class-Content/03-javascript/01-Activities/23-RPS-Coded/Solved/rps-6.html) in `23-RPS-Coded/Solved`, and walk students through the solution. Use the comments in the solution to help guide the conversation.

    ```js
      // Creates an array that lists out all of the options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
      var computerChoices = ["r", "p", "s"];

      // Creating variables to hold the number of wins, losses, and ties. They start at 0.
      var wins = 0;
      var losses = 0;
      var ties = 0;

      for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        // Randomly chooses a choice from the options array. This is the Computer's guess.
        var computerGuess = computerChoices[Math.floor(Math.random() * computerChoices.length)];

        // Collect the user's response and convert to lower case.
        var userGuess = prompt("Enter r, p, or s to play!");
        userGuess = userGuess.toLowerCase();

        // Only run game logic if user chose a valid option
        if (userGuess === "r" || userGuess === "p" || userGuess === "s") {

          alert("The computer chose " + computerGuess);

          // Win/lose conditions:
          if ((userGuess === "r" && computerGuess === "s") ||
            (userGuess === "s" && computerGuess === "p") || 
            (userGuess === "p" && computerGuess === "r")) {
            wins++;
            alert("You've won " + wins + " time(s)!");
          } else if (userGuess === computerGuess) {
            ties++;
            alert("You've tied " + ties + " time(s).");
          } else {
            losses++;
            alert("You've lost " + losses + " time(s).");
          }
        }
      }

      // When the game is over, alert the totals to the user. We can use the \n character to make a line break.
      alert("Total wins: " + wins + "\nTotal ties: " + ties + "\nTotal losses: " + losses);
    ```
