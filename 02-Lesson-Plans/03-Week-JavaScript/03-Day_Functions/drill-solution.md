# Self-Closing Tags

* What is a self-closing tag?

Tags which do not require a closing / inside the tag but it can be preferable to add it, as some frameworks require it.

* Give examples of self-closing tags.

    * `<br/>`
    * `<hr/>`
    * `<img/>`
    * `<meta/>`
    * `<link/>`
    * `<input/>`

* What differentiates these elements from others?

Self-closing tags are used for what are called void elements like horizontal rules and line breaks. These are called void elements because they inherently cannot have content. There is no way to add text to a line break, so there is no need for an opening and closing set of tags. Similarly, you can't add text to a horizontal rule, so there is no need for an opening and closing set of tags. In general, any tag that can't hold text can be self-closing.

TL;DR - They can't contain additional content.
