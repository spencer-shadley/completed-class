### Pre-class Drill

* Let students know that it's time for the preclass drill of the day. Remind them that interviewing is a skill that is in some ways separate from practical coding, and that they need to work hard to hone this skillset during this course. The class is designed to make them great developers, and these pre-class questions are designed to make them awesome interviewers.

* Encourage students to begin by pseudo-coding. Remind them that many companies are judging more on problem solving skills than coding chops, so having strong pseudo-coding skills to fall back on may just land them their dream job one day. You should encourage some white boarding from students (when relevant) and explain why it's beneficial for them to do it in the classroom rather than wait for their first time to be during interviews, but move on if there are no volunteers. Discourage heavy pressure for students.

* 20 min before class starts write the following problem on the board or Slack it out:

```
 What is a self-closing tag? Provide 3 examples. Why are these tags self-closing? What differentiates these elements from others?

```

* Encourage students to practice their critical thinking rather than their Googling skills here.

* After 15 minutes take 5 minutes to go over the solution. You should start recording when going over the answer and Slack out the answer at the end of office hours before class starts.

* Ask students to share their answers.

* Be sure to praise students who provide a solution even if it isn't fully correct. Discuss its merits and potential pitfalls.

* Provide your own answer or the one below:

> "Self-closing tags are tags that don't require a closing tag. Examples include `br`, `hr`, `img` tags. Self-closing tags do not require a closing `/` inside the tag but it can be preferable to add it, as some frameworks require it."
> "Self-closing tags are used for what are called void elements like horizontal rules and line breaks. These are called void elements because they inherently cannot have content. There is no way to add text to a line break, so there is no need for an opening and closing set of tags. Similarly, you can't add text to a horizontal rule, so there is no need for an opening and closing set of tags. In general, any tag that can't hold text can be self-closing."
