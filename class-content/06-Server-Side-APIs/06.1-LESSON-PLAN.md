# 6.1 - Intro to APIs and AJAX

- Before class, create an account at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/).

- This week's Giphy activities will require students to use an API key from [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/). Please have them create an account and apply for a key before class starts in order to have it approved and activated in time for the activity.

- Be sure to slack out this [tutorial on the OpenWeatherMap API](http://osp123.github.io/tutorials/html/weatherAPI.html) as pre-reading for this week's content.

- Keep in mind that since Heroku serves its content using HTTPS, all external resources need to use HTTPS as well, else they may be blocked by the browser. Most examples in the Giphy documentation use HTTP, but HTTPS is available as well. This isn't likely to pose an issue today, but students may run into it when they deploy their homework assignments.

### Stu: 01-CustomerObject

- (5 min)

simple warm-up activity

### Ins: Review

1005-10

- (5 min)

fill in the `console.log`s

live code

### Ins: New York Times Scraper Demo

1010-20

- (10 min)

[NYT Scraper](http://nyt-mongo-scraper.herokuapp.com/)

Scrape new articles retrieves from New York Times with a "Save" button

show the API in the network tab

[NYT Scraper API](http://nyt-mongo-scraper.herokuapp.com/api/headlines)

it's storing this as JSON (JavaScript objects) with multiple types

this is really common to send data

### Everyone Do: 02-1-nyt-scraper

1020-25

- (5 min)

try it out - look at the data

ask questions as you read

Ask: Explain how this is working

### Stu: 02-2-api-research

1025-32

- (7 min)

students do self-research on APIs

### Everyone Do: Review 02-2-api-research

1032-37

- (5 min)

Have students share their answers to these questions.

### Ins: API Experimenting

1043-53

- (10 min)

Find a fact about a number

[Numbers](https://rapidapi.com/divad12/api/numbers-1)

[Anime](https://rapidapi.com/vikhyat/api/hummingbird-v1)

[PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

### Ins: API Definitions

1037-43

- (6 min)

Imagine building a computer for scratch. Let's pretend the hardware is all good.

It's virtually impossible. We need building blocks. Those building blocks become APIs that can be shared and reused.

Show airbnb using Google Maps APIs

Have you heard of How to Make Everything
How to Make a \$1,500 sandwich in only 6 months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URvWSsAgtJE&vl=en

To get cheese - drive to a farm, milk a cow, harvest wheat, ferment, etc. and you eventually get a slice of cheese

Even jQuery is just a bunch of APIs [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

We will cover APIs in more detail in future classes

### Stu: 02-3-api-experimenting

1053-1103

- (10 min)

Use rapidapi to find more APIs and experiment

### Ins: OMDb API Demo

1103-08

- (5 min)

[OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

this API provides a database of information on nearly every movie in existence

key1 (paid): trilogy
key2: 1961397d

Use the examples to search for "Naruto"

demo searching for "Naruto" in the Network tab

Ask:

- How are different parameters separated?
- How are values assigned to each parameter?
- What does the `+` signify?
- What are the parameters keys? What are the values for each parameter key?
- What does the `t` mean?

[search for naruto](http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=1961397d&s=naruto)

Blood Prison is my favorite movie - add `&y=2011`

### Stu: 02-4-omdb-api-exploration

1108-18

- (10 min)

- Have students explore the OMDb API themselves.

### Everyone Do: 02-5-omdb-api-urls

- (10 min)

### BREAK

1128-1208

- (40 min)

### Ins: 02-6-Ajax_OMDB

1208-18

- (10 min)

make an ajax call using jquery

live code [02-6-Ajax_OMDB]

include `console.log` after to show async

ask: what's going to log first?

this is async

already used async with setTimeout and setInterval

they get executed when they're ready. WHENEVER that is.

this is, specifically, a promise

it guarantees it will be executed eventually

native JavaScript

```js
var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhttp.open('GET', queryURL);
xhttp.send();
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
    console.log(this.responseText);
  }
};
```

add a second ajax call for another movie or use [02-Ajax_OMDB/multiple-ajax.html]

### Everyone Do: Logging JSON

1218-23

- (5 min)

- Ask students how they might parse out and retrieve the movie's runtime or actors list in response? (Show the JSON on the side).

### Stu: 02-7-ajax-query

1223-38

- (15 min)

students will try it themselves - try out the APIs to get movies

### Stu: 03-AJAX_to_HTML

1238-53

- (15 min)

It's important to be able to read documentation on various APIs without help.

Try reading the Giphy API documentation and answer questions in 04-1-giphy-documentation

[Giphy API Documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/)

### Ins: 04-Giphy_API

(optional)

- If any time remains, have students create their own AJAX calls to the Giphy API. Have them try to create a website with buttons that launch searches for Gifs associated with specific terms.
