## Instructions

- Now it's your turn! Using the example AJAX code given to you, create an AJAX call to the OMDb API of your own.

- Then try logging any property about the movie to your console.

### Bonus

Try combining multiple responses. For example, make requests to retrieve three of your favorite movies and in _one_ `console.log` include the year of each of those movies.
