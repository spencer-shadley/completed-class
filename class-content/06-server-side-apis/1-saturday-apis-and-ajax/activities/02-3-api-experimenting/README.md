# 02-3-api-experimenting

## Instructions

- Using the [RapidAPI library](https://rapidapi.com/) as a starting point experiment with a few APIs of your own.

- Note: You will need to create an account on RapidAPI first.

- Note: Use the "free" filter, as some APIs require an subscription.

- Note: Not all of the APIs are easy to use, just keep experimenting!
