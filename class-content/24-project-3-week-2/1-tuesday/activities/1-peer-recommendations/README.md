# Peer Recommendations

## LinkedIn

Recommendations are an important way to recognize the successes a person has achieved and provide evidence of their skills to a recruiter.

Think of the people who you have worked with. These can be your teammates on this project, previous projects or anyone else you've worked with throughout the class. Who has demonstrated a skill you value? Who has helped you on this journey? Who do you want to thank?

Take the time to write [recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/90/recommendations-overview) for anyone you want to recognize.

We have reserved some time in-class to work on this but it is likely you will continue after class to recommend more people. Helping other people has a way of coming back to help you, try to help as many as you can with authentic recommendations.

Take the time to [endorse relevant skills](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/33196/endorsing-someone-s-skills) as well.
