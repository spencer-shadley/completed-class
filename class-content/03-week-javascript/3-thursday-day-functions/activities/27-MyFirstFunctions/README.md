### Instructions

- Working in pairs and using the starter file above, fill in the missing functions and function calls.

- **NOTE:** Try to finish all four functions if you can, but don't be distressed if you only get one or two. The important thing is that you get at least one function fully done.

- **HINT:** You will need to [read documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) on how to use `typeof` for the `isString` function.

- **HINT:** Look back to previous example if you need help.

- **BONUS 1:** If you finish the first four functions create two functions, `adderReturn()` and `multiplierReturn()`, that return the value when you call the function rather than using `console.log`.

- **BONUS 2:** Write a function with four parameters. The first parameter is used to determine which operation (add or multiply) to use and the next three are combined using that operation which is output with `console.log`.
