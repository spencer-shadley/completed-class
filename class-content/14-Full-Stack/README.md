# Unit 14: Full-Stack

## Overview

In the previous unit, we modularized our applications following the MVC paradigm and integrated a custom ORM into the Model layer. Like all things in software development, when we find ourselves repeating a task, we look for programmatic solutions. Because the implementation of object-relational mapping is a common task in full-stack web development, third-party libraries emerged to do the heavy-lifting for us. In this unit we will integrate Sequelize, a popular Node.js ORM, into our newly modularized applications.

## Key Topics

- Sequelize
- sequelize-cli
- CRUD
- Models
- Validations
- Associations

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. What is a Model?
2. What are two approaches to using Sequelize in a full-stack web application?
3. How does one perform joins using Sequelize?

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

- Configure a full-stack web application to use the Sequelize ORM library
- Define models that POST data using validations
- Define models that GET data using validations
- Implement CRUD methods using Sequelize
- Implement Sequelize associations to join one or more tables
- Configure Heroku for deployment of an application using Sequelize

## Homework: Berger 2 The Sequel

- In this assignment, you're going to Sequelize the Burger app you made last unit. We've split this exercise into three different tiers, all with different tasks and expectations. Finish whichever tier will provide you with the most reasonable challenge.
