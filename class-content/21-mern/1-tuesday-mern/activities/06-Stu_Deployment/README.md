# Deployment

In this activity we will deploy the React Reading List application to Heroku.

## Instructions

- Deploy the React Reading List application to Heroku. Make sure to perform the following:

  - Create a git repo with the React Reading List App code

  - Create a Heroku app for the React Reading List App (`heroku create my-app-name`)

  - Add an mLab Addon for the React Reading List Heroku app

  - Add and commit your changes before pushing up to heroku (`git push heroku master`)

### Hints

- Make sure you add and commit all changes before pushing up to Heroku.

- If your deployment fails, run `heroku logs` while in the project directory. This should print all of the logs produced from the failed deployment. Usually the issue can be found at the start of any errors.

- Ask us for help if you get stuck. Help your group if you finish early!
