## Computer Science

### 1

1. Solving a problem - `algorithm`, `vocab`

   ❓ A set of steps to solve a problem or perform a calculation is also known as \_\_\_.

   - a program
   - an algorithm ✔️
   - a recursion
   - a puzzle

### 2

1. A Search - `linear-search`, `vocab`

   ❓ Starting with a list then sequentially checking every item in the list for a search term is also known as a \_\_\_ search.

   - linear ✔️
   - tree
   - sequential
   - binary

### 3

1. Another search - `binary-search`, `vocab`

   ❓ Starting with a sorted list then repeatedly halving the list to the portion that could contain the search term is also known as a \_\_\_ search.

   - linear
   - tree
   - halving
   - binary ✔️

### 4

1. Linear Search - `linear-search`, `vocab`

   ❓ In a linear search, doubling the length of an input array being searched causes \_\_\_ of the time required to complete the search.

   - doubling ✔️
   - tripling
   - quadrupling
   - no change

### 5

1. Sorting Example - `selection-sort`, `vocab`

   ❓ An example of \_\_\_ sort might be repeatedly scanning through a list of numbers, finding the smallest number, and moving it into its position in an array.

   - a quick
   - an insertion
   - a bubble
   - a selection ✔️

### 6

1. Another Sorting Example - `insertion-sort`, `vocab`

   ❓ John has to sort a list of numbers. He writes code to loop over the list, comparing two numbers at a time, and swapping them if the first is more than the second number. This repeats until the current number is less than the next number, or until it reaches the end of the list. This is an example of \_\_\_ sort.

   - a quick
   - an insertion ✔️
   - a bubble
   - a selection

### 7

1. More Sorting - `quick-sort`, `vocab`

   ❓ In \_\_\_ sort of a list of numbers, a pivot number is selected, then every number less than the pivot is moved to the left, and every number moved to the right in a process of partitioning. This is repeated with by selecting a pivot in each partition until partitions with just one number remain.

   - a quick ✔️
   - an insertion
   - a bubble
   - a selection

### 8

1. Algorithm Efficiency - `time-complexity`, `vocab`

   ❓ When talking about an algorithm's efficiency, \_\_\_ refers to the rate at which an algorithm slows as the input grows.

   - volume
   - time complexity ✔️
   - data throughput
   - instruction absorption

### 9

1. Big-O Notation - `big-o-notation`, `tech-knowledge`

   ❓ An algorithm takes twice as long to run when the input size is doubled. This would be expressed in Big-O notation as \_\_\_.

   - O(1)
   - O(n) ✔️
   - O(n^2)
   - O(2n)

### 10

1. Nested Loop Efficiency - `big-o-notation`, `tech-knowledge`

   ❓ An algorithm uses two nested for loops. The efficiency of this algorithm could be expressed as \_\_\_.

   - O(n)
   - O(n^2) ✔️
   - O(2n)

   - a data structure ✔️
   - a memory core
   - a flash drive
   - an implementation scheme

### 12

1. LIFO structure - `stacks`, `vocab`

   ❓ \_\_\_ are sequenced orders of numbers that only allow access to the top element, a scheme known as LIFO (Last-in-First-out).

   - Stacks ✔️
   - Queues
   - Dictionaries
   - Linked lists

### 13

1. FIFO structure - `queues`, `vocab`

   ❓ \_\_\_ are sequenced orders of numbers that only allow access to the first element, a scheme known as FIFO (First-in-First-out).

   - Stacks
   - Queues ✔️
   - Dictionaries
   - Linked lists

   - Graphs
   - Trees
   - Dictionaries
   - Linked lists ✔️

### 15

1. Object-Array Hybrid - `dictionaries`, `vocab`

   ❓ \_\_\_ are hybrid data structures that can be iterated over like arrays, and have key-value pairs like objects.

   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Dictionaries ✔️
