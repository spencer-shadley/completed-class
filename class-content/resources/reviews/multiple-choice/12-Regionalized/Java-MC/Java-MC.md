   ❓ Unlike arrays, the ArrayList data type \_\_\_.

   - can only hold strings
   - doesn't impose a length constraint ✔️
   - holds lists of numbers only
   - cannot hold image or sound data

### 7

   ❓ The \_\_\_ method can be used to cut an item out of an ArrayList.

   - `delete()`
   - `cut()`
   - `remove()` ✔️
   - `exclude()`

### 8

1. HashMaps - `HashMap`, `put`, `get`, `tech-vocab`

   ❓ When working with HashMaps, the **_ method is used to set a key's value, and the _** method is used to retrieve the key's value.

   - `set()`, `retrieve`
   - `set()`, `get`
   - `put()`, `get` ✔️
   - `put()`, `retrieve`

### 9

1. OOP - `class`, `object`, `tech-knowledge`

   ❓ In Object Oriented Programming languages like Java, **_ is like a blueprint while _** is an instantiated version of it.

   - a class, an object ✔️
   - a hashclass, a method
   - an object, a class
   - a function, an object

### 10

1. OOP methods - `public`, `private`, `tech-knowledge`

   ❓ **_ methods can only be used inside a class while _** methods can be used by anyone.

   - internal, external
   - private, open
   - public, external
   - private, public ✔️

### 11

1. Inheritance - `subclasses`, `extends`, `tech-vocab`

   ❓ Classes that inherit from other classes are called **_, and are created using the _** keyword.

   - subclasses, `extends` ✔️
   - objects, `inherits`
   - children, `includes`
   - minors, `follows`

### 12

1. Objects of many forms - `polymorphism`, `tech-vocab`

   ❓ The ability of an object to take on many forms, through using superclasses to instantiate subclasses, is known as \_\_\_.

   - subclassification
   - extension
   - polymorphism ✔️
   - derivation

### 13

1. Subclass access - `private`, `protected`, `tech-knowledge`

   ❓ Unlike fields declared as private, those declared as \_\_\_ are available to subclasses.

   - personal
   - protected ✔️
   - superPrivate
   - pseudoPublic

### 14

1. Behavior and implementation - `interface`, `tech-knowledge`

   ❓ Java has a tool called \_\_\_ that allows for only defining what behaviors a subclass should have, without providing any implementation.

   - an interface ✔️
   - a method
   - inheritance
   - instantiation

### 15

1. Dealing with problems - `error`, `exception`, `tech-vocab`

   ❓ \_\_\_ indicate serious problems that applications **should not** try to catch, while exceptions indicate problems that applications **should** try to catch.

   - exceptions, errors
