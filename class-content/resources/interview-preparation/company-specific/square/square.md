## Recruiter Tips

Pair Programming:

- During the interview, you will write and compile code in a collaborative plain text editor or IDE called CoderPad.
- You can program in the language of your choice; choose the one you’re strongest in, rather than one you just recently learned.
- The interviewer will present a question and you’ll have approximately 45 minutes to come to a working solution.
- Our interview questions cover object oriented programming and algorithms; we’re focused on building and iterating on runnable code.
- We want to hear your thought process as you program. Please speak up, especially if you hit a roadblock.
- There should be about 10-15 minutes at the end to ask questions about our teams, company culture, or anything else on your mind.

Additional Preparation:

- Run your code early and often, rather than waiting until the end.

- Be sure to conduct some research from third party sources, [here’s one](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/17/square-benefits-from-word-of-mouth-dorsey.html) that will provide a broader perspective of our product and the impact within the community.
