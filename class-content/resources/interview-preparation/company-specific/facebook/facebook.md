Before you start your interview prep journey, [WATCH THIS VIDEO FIRST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDTKnzrX6qU). This 15min YouTube video by Chris Jereza does an excellent breakdown on what content/resources you need to know, how to prepare, and the mindset you will need going into it.

Coding Interview Prep
It's extremely important for you to review these concepts before every stage of the interview process with us. I’ve highlighted some key links/ tools to use when studying :)

Coding During the Interview
You can answer the questions in the language that you feel most comfortable with. However, if you are experienced with a multitude of languages, it might be best to code in the one that provides the most optimal/speedy solution to the problem. It's also important that you think out loud/provide a narrative as you go through the problem so the engineer has insight into your thought process.

We assess the coding portion based on a few things:

Communication - Does the person ask clarifying questions, or do they just dive in to the code? Asking clarifying questions will help the interviewer understand your problem solving skills, and will also help you create a better solution. Interviews comment on this frequently.

Speed – Can the engineer we are assessing move fast? It is very important that you practice coding quickly, as we see interviewers commenting on this frequently as well.

Quality -– Is the code clean/bug free? If not, it’s okay to fix bugs and optimize the solution, but this may affect your ability to solve more than one coding problem within 45 minutes.

CS Fundamentals to Review
Before the interview, we strongly encourage you to have a full understanding of the following techniques (although not limited to) that can be applied to many different kinds of questions and also can assist in solving the problems in the most speedy and efficient manner: algorithms, design patterns, data structures, recursions, binary tree questions. Also, it’s important to reacquaint yourself to core computer science concepts & general software engineering skills (study the basics) and topics related to the scale of our environment. You will be asked about o Memory constraints on the space complexity of the algorithm you are writing, and its running time - O(N^2) to O(N) etc.

Algorithms to study:

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Binary Search

Data Structures to study:

- Arrays/ArrayLists
- Hash Tables
- Trees
- Graphs
- Stacks/Queues
- Heaps

Concepts to know:

- Big O
- Recursion
- Memoization/Dynamic Programming

Tips and Things to Know

The interview will be approximately 45 mins long using Coderpad, a virtual whiteboard where the engineer can review your code (we will send you a link in advance) - No Xcode, autocomplete, or online lookups.
Practice speaking in proofs (contrapositive, contradiction, cases, induction) and code out loud. The interviewer needs wants to know where you are headed with your solutions and the justifications for it. “If everything you say sounds like a proof, you basically win” – Chris Jereza
Most people study 2-3 weeks and practice on a whiteboard or coding competition websites beforehand.
Discuss initial ideas and solutions with your interviewer, which will help you to clarify any ambiguity.
Utilize the hints given! The interviewer will give you hints along the way if you are headed into the wrong direction. It’s crucial to be self-aware and receptive which might involve changing or tweaking your prior solution when hinted at.
Generally, avoid solutions with lots of edge cases or huge if/else if/else blocks. Deciding between iteration and recursion is always an important step.
Think about different algorithms and algorithmic techniques (sorting, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming/memoization, recursion).
Think about data structures, particularly the ones used most often (Array, Stack/Queue, Hashset/Hashmap/Hashtable/Dictionary, Tree/Binary Tree, Heap, Graph, Bloom Filter, etc.)
Don’t worry about rote memorization such as runtimes or API/native calls. It's good to know how to figure out approximate runtimes on the fly but the code you write is more important.
Please prepare any questions you have before the interview and also be prepared to answer why you are interested in Facebook. The engineers like to see people who know about our technical environment, projects, challenges, etc. Also, your excitement about Facebook goes a long way! :)

Typical Non-Technical Questions Asked
—Imagine it is your first day here at Facebook. What do you want to work on? What features would you improve on?
—Why are you interested in Facebook? Know about our technical environment, projects, challenges, etc. and be excited!
—What are the most interesting projects you have worked on and how might they be relevant to the Facebook environment.
—What are some of the biggest professional challenges you have faced, and how you have overcome them.

Below (and attached) is interview prep for you to review.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.  I look forward to hearing back from you!

Regarding learning more about some of the unique challenges that we face, there is a lot of content on our eng blog post https://www.facebook.com/Engineering. We have written a few academic papers that  you might find interesting too: https://www.facebook.com/publications/ . You may be interested in the papers/blogs on memcache, TAO, wormhole, haystack, and analysis of facebook photo caching for some of the distributed systems work. In addition, facebook open source projects like RocksDB, Mcrouter and Presto may give you some idea about some of the recent trends.

The interviewers will focus on your technical ability and expertise: coding and algorithms, design/architecture-oriented questions as well as your particular interests and motivations.

Coding questions – You will be asked to produce clean, efficient code in a reasonable amount of time (in the programming language of your choice). You will be coding by hand on a whiteboard, so you may want to practice using pen and paper. A few important points about the coding questions: during the interview explain your thought process out loud; articulate/code up a working solution (even if it feels inefficient) and then iterate rather than immediately trying to jump to the clever solution; and lastly, if you cannot explain your solution clearly in 5 minutes, it's probably too complex for the problem at hand.

Areas that may be covered:
- Coding in your most comfortable language
- CS Fundamentals
- Algorithm Design / Analysis
- Data structures
- System Design
- Scalability
- Facebook Platform and products, and what you would do to improve or change them

Design/Architecture questions - Can you arrive at an answer in the face of unusual constraints? We want to see how well you can visualize the entire problem and solution space. We also want to see how much you've thought about Facebook in particular and some of the unique problems we face. For example: How would you architect a world-wide video distribution system?  Or Facebook chat? Think distributed systems and APIs – and focus on building/implementing a structure or product. Examples of questions: If you were to rebuild the FB chat/messenger, how would you do that? Explain how you would design “News Feed” for Facebook? Redesign “Timeline”? Build a mobile tourist application?

You must drive this conversation. Consider all tradeoffs for the decisions that you make while coming up with this product/system design. The engineer is evaluating your thought process. Pretend the interviewer is your teammate and you are working  with them on a high level design of a new product.

In short, the design interview will focus on creating and scaling a product or system from scratch. 

A successful interview will show that you:
- clearly understand the problem
- propose a design for a product/system and break it down into components that can be built independently
- identify the bottlenecks as the product/system scales and can poke holes in the design itself
- understand how to adapt your solution when requirements are changed
- draw diagrams that clearly describe the relationship between the different components in your product/system
- calculate (back-of-the-envelope) the physical resources necessary to make this product/system work
- create necessary tests and identify how to judge the success of your product/system

Be prepared to talk about:
- Why you want to work at Facebook
- Current projects and details
- Why you would like a change
- What you hope to work on at Facebook
- What you love about your current position and/or being a developer
