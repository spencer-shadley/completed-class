Before you start your interview prep journey, [WATCH THIS VIDEO FIRST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDTKnzrX6qU). This 15min YouTube video by Chris Jereza does an excellent breakdown on what content/resources you need to know, how to prepare, and the mindset you will need going into it.

Coding Interview Prep
It's extremely important for you to review these concepts before every stage of the interview process with us. I’ve highlighted some key links/ tools to use when studying :)

Coding During the Interview
You can answer the questions in the language that you feel most comfortable with. However, if you are experienced with a multitude of languages, it might be best to code in the one that provides the most optimal/speedy solution to the problem. It's also important that you think out loud/provide a narrative as you go through the problem so the engineer has insight into your thought process.

We assess the coding portion based on a few things:

Communication - Does the person ask clarifying questions, or do they just dive in to the code? Asking clarifying questions will help the interviewer understand your problem solving skills, and will also help you create a better solution. Interviews comment on this frequently.

Speed – Can the engineer we are assessing move fast? It is very important that you practice coding quickly, as we see interviewers commenting on this frequently as well.

Quality -– Is the code clean/bug free? If not, it’s okay to fix bugs and optimize the solution, but this may affect your ability to solve more than one coding problem within 45 minutes.

CS Fundamentals to Review
Before the interview, we strongly encourage you to have a full understanding of the following techniques (although not limited to) that can be applied to many different kinds of questions and also can assist in solving the problems in the most speedy and efficient manner: algorithms, design patterns, data structures, recursions, binary tree questions. Also, it’s important to reacquaint yourself to core computer science concepts & general software engineering skills (study the basics) and topics related to the scale of our environment. You will be asked about o Memory constraints on the space complexity of the algorithm you are writing, and its running time - O(N^2) to O(N) etc.

Algorithms to study:

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Binary Search

Data Structures to study:

- Arrays/ArrayLists
- Hash Tables
- Trees
- Graphs
- Stacks/Queues
- Heaps

Concepts to know:

- Big O
- Recursion
- Memoization/Dynamic Programming

Tips and Things to Know

The interview will be approximately 45 mins long using Coderpad, a virtual whiteboard where the engineer can review your code (we will send you a link in advance) - No Xcode, autocomplete, or online lookups.
Practice speaking in proofs (contrapositive, contradiction, cases, induction) and code out loud. The interviewer needs wants to know where you are headed with your solutions and the justifications for it. “If everything you say sounds like a proof, you basically win” – Chris Jereza
Most people study 2-3 weeks and practice on a whiteboard or coding competition websites beforehand.
Discuss initial ideas and solutions with your interviewer, which will help you to clarify any ambiguity.
Utilize the hints given! The interviewer will give you hints along the way if you are headed into the wrong direction. It’s crucial to be self-aware and receptive which might involve changing or tweaking your prior solution when hinted at.
Generally, avoid solutions with lots of edge cases or huge if/else if/else blocks. Deciding between iteration and recursion is always an important step.
Think about different algorithms and algorithmic techniques (sorting, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming/memoization, recursion).
Think about data structures, particularly the ones used most often (Array, Stack/Queue, Hashset/Hashmap/Hashtable/Dictionary, Tree/Binary Tree, Heap, Graph, Bloom Filter, etc.)
Don’t worry about rote memorization such as runtimes or API/native calls. It's good to know how to figure out approximate runtimes on the fly but the code you write is more important.
Please prepare any questions you have before the interview and also be prepared to answer why you are interested in Facebook. The engineers like to see people who know about our technical environment, projects, challenges, etc. Also, your excitement about Facebook goes a long way! :)

Typical Non-Technical Questions Asked
—Imagine it is your first day here at Facebook. What do you want to work on? What features would you improve on?
—Why are you interested in Facebook? Know about our technical environment, projects, challenges, etc. and be excited!
—What are the most interesting projects you have worked on and how might they be relevant to the Facebook environment.
—What are some of the biggest professional challenges you have faced, and how you have overcome them.

The “Cracking the Facebook Coding Interview” prep sessions taught by Gayle Laakmann McDowell (the author), have been very effective for many candidates. You can watch a recorded version of her talk in the links below and a graphic to summarize the content: http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/handout_-_cracking_the_coding_skills.png
