Many of the questions asked in Google interviews are open-ended because our engineers are looking to see how you engage the problem. Be sure to talk through your thought process about the questions you are asked, as well as your approach to problems and solutions. As discussed, here is an overview of the first round interview:

1.You will be asked an open ended question. Ask clarifying questions in order to devise the requirements. Think about ways to improve the solution you'll present. In many cases, the first answer that springs to mind may need some refining. It is worthwhile to talk about your initial thoughts to a question, then take the time to compose a more efficient solution.

2. You will be asked to create and explain it in an algorithm.

3. Then convert it to a workable code. Be prepared to write at least 20 lines of c# in a live Google document. Approach all scripting as a coding exercise - this should be tactical coding - clean, rich, robust code.

(Hint: Don't worry about getting it perfect because by the time you know it, the 40 minutes will be up. Write what comes but then refine it later. Also make sure you consider corner cases and edge cases, production ready.)

4. Optimize the code, follow it with test cases, find any bugs.

A few topics that might be covered: algorithms, APIs, big O notation, quicksort, merge sort, heaps, binary tree, linked list, hash table, recursions, iteraters, lockings, powers of 2, corner cases, ,++I, I ++, fig - fog - dog
