# General Recruiter Email Tips

Many of the questions asked in Google interviews are open-ended because our engineers are looking to see how you engage the problem. Be sure to talk through your thought process about the questions you are asked, as well as your approach to problems and solutions. As discussed, here is an overview of the first round interview:

1.You will be asked an open ended question. Ask clarifying questions in order to devise the requirements. Think about ways to improve the solution you'll present. In many cases, the first answer that springs to mind may need some refining. It is worthwhile to talk about your initial thoughts to a question, then take the time to compose a more efficient solution.

2. You will be asked to create and explain it in an algorithm.

3. Then convert it to a workable code. Be prepared to write at least 20 lines of your preferred coding language in a live Google document. Approach all scripting as a coding exercise - this should be tactical coding - clean, rich, robust code.

(Hint: Don't worry about getting it perfect because by the time you know it, the 40 minutes will be up. Write what comes but then refine it later. Also make sure you consider corner cases and edge cases, production ready.)

4. Optimize the code, follow it with test cases, find any bugs.

A few topics that might be covered: algorithms, APIs, big O notation, quicksort, merge sort, heaps, binary tree, linked list, hash table, recursions, iteraters, lockings, powers of 2, corner cases, ,++I, I ++, fig - fog - dog

# SRE Specific Resources

The Site Reliability Engineering team is one of the most visible and respected teams within Google, and the most mission-critical. This role combines software development and systems engineering expertise to build and run large-scale, massively distributed, fault-tolerant software, systems, and infrastructure. What really stands out about this position is that you are working with the largest infrastructure in the world and at the largest scale within Google. We are especially looking for engineers who love to build things, code on a regular basis, and enjoy being challenged by problems of scale and complexity. Our engineers work primarily on software development, automation, high-level system architecture, networking, algorithms and data structures, and general problem-solving.

Google is constantly expanding, collaborating, and creating - we are actually about five years ahead of current technology and you'll be in the center of this cutting-edge innovation. Also, what's special about this team is that there is a lot of portability available- engineers are free to participate in whatever projects and products they find interesting. Another bonus is our 20% project, which encourages engineers to get involved with projects outside of their main focus area.

The SRE team works on projects such as BigTable, Spanner and Chubby in production. Right now some hot topics for our team are storage, containers, Big Data, file systems, and our Kubernetes open source project -- really trying to scale at the next level.

To give you a little more information about Site Reliability Engineering and the impact they make on all of our users, I've included a few links that I think you might find interesting:
