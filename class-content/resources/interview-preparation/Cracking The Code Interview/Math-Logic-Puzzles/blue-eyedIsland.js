/* 
**************** QUESTION DESCRIPTION ***********************

    A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible.
    There will be a flight out at 8:00pm every evening.
    Each person can see everyone else's eye color, but they do not know thier own (nor is anyone to tell them).
    Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eys, althought they do know that at least one person does.
    How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?
