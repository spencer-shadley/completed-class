# Recursion

## About

Recursion is a fundamental part of computer science. There are two ways we solve problems - iteratively or recursively. Every problem we've solved so far has been iteratively (a function does some direct computation, maybe calls some other functions and completes.)

The other way to solve a problem is recursively. This just means a function calls itself. This can be tricky to wrap your head around.

## Requirements

1. A base case - something very simple that your function can directly solve
1. A recursive call to a sub-problem - you need to break your problem down and call the function with a slightly simpler version of itself
