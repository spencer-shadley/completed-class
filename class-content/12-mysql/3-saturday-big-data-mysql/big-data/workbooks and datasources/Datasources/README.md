# Datasources

These are the datasources for each of the workbooks found [here](../)

## File Types

`hyper` is the tableau database type. Tableau generates this when extracting data from a live datasource. [More info.](https://www.tableau.com/products/new-features/hyper)

`csv` is "comma separated values", just text often generated from spreadsheet tools like Excel

## Google Sheets

Below are the Google Sheets Datasources used in the [workbooks](../workbooks%20and%20datasources):
- [Germ Theory of Disease (both workbooks)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_5QjzzBa5EoLQKM8MVgpHi4jbHLf5PrPBBk6cG0T7KE/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Anime](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17KQKFy9o1pPG0Yko2dTYZcRhNSTdNWyI3NLWsJyfqbI/edit?usp=sharing)

Note: `twbx` files have the datasource (as a `.hyper` file) embedded so there are no additional required datasource files
