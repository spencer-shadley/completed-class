# Instructions

- Now that we have learned how to import big collections of data into a server, it is time to put this new knowledge to the test by importing all of the data contained within `TopSongs.csv` into our database.

  - HINT: Remember, bigger datasets require more time to import properly, so be patient

  - HINT: If you feel that the import process is taking far too long, feel free to use `Top1000Songs.csv` instead. We would highly recommend working with the bigger dataset if you can, however.

  - HINT: Take the downtime you have been given to start on the next part of the activity

- With all of your data successfully imported into the database, begin working on a Node console application which will allow you to collect more specialized pieces of data. For example...

  - A query which returns all data for songs sung by a specific artist
  - A query which returns all artists who appear within the top 5000 more than once
  - A query which returns all data contained within a specific range
  - A query which searches for a specific song in the top 5000 and returns the data for it

## Hint

- There are some SQL statements we have not covered yet that might make it easier. Try Googling or reading through SQL documentation to see if there are any statements that would be helpful. W3Schools, as always, [has great information](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) on this.

## Bonus

- Investigate [MySQL indexing]([this article explaining MySQL indexes](https://atech.blog/viaduct/mysql-indexes-primer))
