# Promise Constructor

In this activity you will refactor a callback-based asynchronous function to utilize Promises.

## Instructions

- Open `Unsolved/index.js` and take a moment to examine the provided code.

- When the provided code is run, the `waitFor` function waits `2` (or however many seconds are provided) and then prints a message. If `seconds` is not a number or is a number less than 1, an error is thrown instead.

- Refactor the `waitFor` function to use Promises instead of callbacks.

- You should be able to call the refactored `waitFor` function like so:

```js
waitFor(2)
  .then(msg => {
    console.log(msg); // msg is printed since seconds is more than 0
  })
  .catch(err => console.error(err));

waitFor(-5)
  .then(msg => console.log(msg))
  .catch(
    err => console.error(err) // error is printed since 'seconds' is less than 1
  );
```

## ðŸ’¡ Hints

- Refer back to the previous demo for an example using the Promise constructor.

- Check out the [MDN Documentation on Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

## Bonus

- Convert to ES6 arrow functions

- Play code golf
