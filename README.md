# Full-Stack Ground Curriculum

## Overview

Welcome to the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp! The repository houses the Ground curriculum and is divided into two pillars:

- student-facing **Class Content**

- instructor-facing **Lesson Plans**.

### Class Content

You will find unit overviews, all activitiy files, and homework instructions and solutions in [01-Class-Content](01-Class-Content).

Use these materials to build your class repository.

### Lesson Plans

You will find grading rubrics, links to slide decks and time trackers, and lesson plans organized by program in [02-lesson-plans](02-lesson-plans).

üìù These materials are _not_ to be shared with students.
