# About

After completing my Full Stack Web Development class for the University of Washgington I am making the finalized version available to other instructors. I made a number of changes from the core curriculum that I thought may be helpful for others as well.

Each repo has a `README` to help guide through its structure.

## [class-content](./class-content)

This directory is the repository slowly built-up which the students have access to

## [full-stack-ground](./full-stack-ground)

This directory is the repository only available to the instructional staff
