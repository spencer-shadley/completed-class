## Intro to ReactJS

_If pacing on activities is a bit too fast this unit, remember that you have
some time at the end of the week to review. Please let us know by opening
an issue if any activities in particular need a bit more time, so we can
adjust the schedule for the unit._

### Overview

In this unit, we will introduce students to React, a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Before that, however,
they need a basic primer in ES6.

We'll go over key features of the framework: JSX, components, states, props, lifecycle events and so on. By the end of this unit, students should understand how React lets web devs build quicker and less resource-hungry sites than mere HTML and jQuery.

After working extensively with the React library, we will introduce final projects.
