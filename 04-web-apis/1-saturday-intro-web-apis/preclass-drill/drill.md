# Pseudocode making a PB&J sandwich

# Write a function that takes in two numbers and logs the max (the greater of the two numbers)

Ex:
Input: 1, 2
Output: 2

Input: 6, -4
Output: 6

Input: 3.4, 2
Output: 3.4

## Bonus 1

Instead of logging the max, return it. Then call it twice - one which takes the result and `alert`s it and another which `console.log`s it.

## Bonus 2

Update your function to use a "ternary" if
