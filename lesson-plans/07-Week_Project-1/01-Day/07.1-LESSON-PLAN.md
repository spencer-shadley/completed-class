# 07.1 Lesson Plan: Project Week(s)

## Overview

Today's class introduces Project 1 and Agile software development.

- If students complain about group configurations, remind them of the following:

  - In the real-world, you don't get to choose your co-workers

  - Working collaboratively is an important skill to acquire as a developer

- Students will be allowed to form their own groups for the final project.

- The first 50 minutes of class are lecture on agile software development. Students then break into groups to brainstorm ideas and prepare user stories and wireframes. Use the time after break to meet with each team to discuss their idea and course correct as you see fit.
