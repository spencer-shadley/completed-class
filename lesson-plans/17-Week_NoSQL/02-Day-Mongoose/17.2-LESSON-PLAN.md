# 17.2 - Intro To Mongoose

## Instructor Do: Welcome Class and Reintroduce Career Services

- 630-45 (15 min)

- Today we are going to cover mongoose, an ODM

  - type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more out of the box

  - schema - rules for data

  - CRUD with mongoose

  - build relationships between collections

- Now that we are 2/3rds of the way through let's talk about career services

  - talk to Jen with questions

### Ins: 09-Stu-MongoJS-Review

- 645-705 (20 min)

- let's review mongojs

- demo the app

- they will add routes to display and edit book data

### Ins: Review

- 705-15 (10 min)

- notice that we don't need a route for root, instead we are using `express.static`

### Ins: 10-Ins-Mongoose-Schema

- 715-25 (10 min)

- SQL can be hard to write and breaks up our flow of object oriented javascript programming so we added sequelize for an ORM

- NoSQL has Object Data Modeling (ODM) and we will use one called mongoose

  - Mongoose lets you define schemas for your collections.

  - It also helps manage data relationships and enforce validations.

- start with `server.js`

- then `exampleModel.js`

- different types have different validators

  - numbers have `min` and `max`

  - strings have `enum`, `match`, `minlength` and `maxlength`

- ask: what are the benefits of mongoose? why do we want this?

  - It let's use create a schema, enforce validations and overall make it easier to interface with a Mongoose database.

### Stu: 11-Stu-Mongoose-Schema

- 725-45 (20 min)

- demo the app (add conflicting emails)

### Ins: Review

- (10 min)

  - We can use `required` to check for the presence of an attribute.

- We can use `validate` to enforce a validation.

- Open [11-Stu-Mongoose-Schema/Solved] in your IDE and step through each attribute, checking for understanding.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const UserSchema = new Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,
    trim: true,
    required: 'Username is Required'
  },

  password: {
    type: String,
    trim: true,
    required: 'Password is Required',
    validate: [({ length }) => length >= 6, 'Password should be longer.']
  },

  email: {
    type: String,
    unique: true,
    match: [/.+@.+\..+/, 'Please enter a valid e-mail address']
  },

  userCreated: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  }
});
```

- Students may be confused with `match`, explain that it uses a regular expression to check for a valid email address.

- Ask the students the following question(s):

  - What is the `match` method checking for in our `email` attribute?

  - It is checking the regular expression against the user's email input.

### BREAK

- (15 min)

### Ins: Custom Methods

- (10 min)

  - Mongoose provides a way for us to create custom methods to manipulate our data.

- Change into [12-Ins-Custom-Methods] and run `npm install` then `node server.js` to launch the app.

- Visit `localhost:3000` and fill out the form to create a new user and demo the response.

  ```js
  {
    "isCool": true,
    "_id": "5cfbbd607de1a557eeaaa056",
    "username": "test...the Coolest!",
    "password": "password1234",
    "email": "testuser@gmail.com",
    "userCreated": "2019-06-08T13:51:28.033Z",
    "__v": 0
  }
  ```

- Ask the students the following question(s):

  - What is difference about the way our data was returned?

  - Our new user has an `isCool` field that is set to `true`.

- Open [12-Ins-Custom-Methods/userModel.js] and scroll down to the custom methods.

- Here

  ```js
  UserSchema.methods.coolifier = function() {
    this.username = `${this.username}...the Coolest!`;
    return this.username;
  };

  UserSchema.methods.makeCool = function() {
    this.isCool = true;
    return this.isCool;
  };
  ```

- Next open `server.js` and demonstrate how we are calling our methods on our new user.

  ```js
  app.post('/submit', ({ body }, res) => {
    const user = new User(body);
    user.coolifier(); // Bob...the Coolest!
    user.makeCool(); // isCool = true;

    User.create(user)
      .then(dbUser => {
        res.json(dbUser);
      })
      .catch(err => {
        res.json(err);
      });
  });
  ```

- Ask the students the following question(s):

  - What are the benefits of using Mongoose?

  - It let's use create a schema, enforce validations and overall make it easier to interface with a Mongoose database.

### Stu: Custom Methods

- (15 min)

- Direct students to the next activity located in [13-Stu-Custom-Methods/Unsolved]

- # Instructions

- Open `userModel.js` and create the following custom methods.

  - `setFullName`: sets the current user's `fullName` property to their lastName appended to their `firstName`

  - `lastUpdatedDate`: sets the current user's `lastUpdated` property to `Date.now()`

- When you are finished use your new custom methods in a `POST` request.

### Ins: Review

- (10 min)

- Change into [13-Stu-Custom-Methods/Solved] and open the `userModel.js` file.

- Ask for a volunteer to lead your through the custom methods they created.

- Next open `server.js` and ask for a volunteer to explain how to call these new methods in that file.

- Start the server and load up the site in your browser to demonstrate the form.

### Ins: Mongoose Populate

- (10 min)

- Change into [14-Ins-Populate] and start the server with `node server.js`.

- Then, visit `/books` to see your books listed.

```js
[
  {
    _id: '5cfbc820bc851f678c714b2c',
    author: 'Herman Melville',
    title: 'Moby Dick',
    __v: 0
  },
  {
    _id: '5cfbc83ebc851f678c714b2d',
    author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald',
    title: 'The Great Gatsby',
    __v: 0
  }
];
```

- Then visit `/library` to see your library data listed in JSON, including a list of `ObjectIds` in the book property. These are the `ObjectIds` associated with each book we've made.

```js
[
  {
    books: [
      '5cfbc510fff60b62b1a9c318',
      '5cfbc51cfff60b62b1a9c319',
      '5cfbc820bc851f678c714b2c',
      '5cfbc83ebc851f678c714b2d'
    ],
    _id: '5cfbc29cfff60b62b1a9c317',
    name: 'Campus Library',
    __v: 0
  }
];
```

- Ask students, what if we want to see the data for all of the books stored in our library. We could go back to books, but what if we want to include all of the information about our library and our books, and query that data with just one call.

  - Answer: This is where `Mongoose`'s populate method comes in. Open the `/populated` route in your browser, and go to the books property. All of the books will be there.

  ```js
  [
    {
      books: [
        {
          _id: '5cfbc820bc851f678c714b2c',
          author: 'Herman Melville',
          title: 'Moby Dick',
          __v: 0
        },
        {
          _id: '5cfbc83ebc851f678c714b2d',
          author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald',
          title: 'The Great Gatsby',
          __v: 0
        }
      ],
      _id: '5cfbc29cfff60b62b1a9c317',
      name: 'Campus Library',
      __v: 0
    }
  ];
  ```

- How does this happen?

  - Show them the `Library.js` model, and how it has a reference to the `Book.js` model inside it's schema.

    ```js
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');

    const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

    const LibrarySchema = new Schema({
      name: {
        type: String,
        unique: true
      },
      books: [
        {
          type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
          ref: 'Book'
        }
      ]
    });

    const Library = mongoose.model('Library', LibrarySchema);

    module.exports = Library;
    ```

  - Then show them the `index.js` file inside of the `models` folder.

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      Book: require('./Book'),
      Library: require('./Library')
    };
    ```

  - Explain that when working with multiple models, it's often useful to be able to require all of them at once, rather than individually.

  - By exporting an object containing all of our models from the `index.js` file in the models folder, we can then require this object and access all of our models inside of `server.js`.

    ```js
    const db = require('./models');
    ```

  - Point out the `populate` method being used in `server.js`.

    ```js
    app.get('/populated', (req, res) => {
      db.Library.find({})
        .populate('books')
        .then(dbLibrary => {
          res.json(dbLibrary);
        })
        .catch(err => {
          res.json(err);
        });
    });
    ```

  - Explain that here we are running `populate("books")` after finding books and before handling the result of the query in `.then`.

### Stu: Mongoose Populate

- (20 min)

- Direct students towards the next activity located in [15-Stu-Populate/Unsolved]

# Instructions

- Open `server.js` and update the `/populate` route to return `Users` populated with notes as JSON to the client.

- **Hint:** Check out the `Note.js` and `User.js` models to see how the schemas there make the populate method possible.

### Ins: Review

- (15 min)

- Open up [15-Stu-Populate/Solved/server.js].

- Ask for a volunteer to to walk you through the solution.

```js
app.get('/populateduser', (req, res) => {
  db.User.find({})
    .populate('notes')
    .then(dbUser => {
      res.json(dbUser);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      res.json(err);
    });
});
```

- Answer any clarifying questions about this activity or any other concepts covered today before wrapping up.
