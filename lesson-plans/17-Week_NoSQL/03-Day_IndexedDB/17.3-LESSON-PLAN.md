# 17.3 - IndexedDB (10:00 AM)

### Ins: Intro To IndexedDB

- 10-1010 (10 min)

- we're going to start with an overview of IndexedDB, go through each function with small activities and ultimately build a mini project with it

- `17-NoSQL\supplemental\indexeddb-guide.md`

- explain transaction using bank purchase

  - gave up durable to enable flush writing for perf gains

    - in case of power failure or something at the right time data is lost

- the web is moving away from cookies and into client-side storage like indexeddb

  - enables things like offline

- How do we store data client-side?

- Cookies, local storage, session storage.

- What is a cookie?

  - A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser.

### Ins: 16-Ins_Opening_IndexedDB

- 1010-15 (5 min)

- let's open a database with `indexeddb`

- it lives on `window`

- it is async, we need to listen to events from the returned `request` object

- demo in chrome (alt+b the file)

- ask: each area of the code

### Stu: 17-Stu_Opening_IndexedDB

- 1015-25 (10 min)

- try opening a db on your machine

### Ins: Review

- 1025-30 (5 min)

- live code, start with debugging the request object

- `onsuccess` is fired every time we make a request

### Ins: Creating Object Stores

- 1030-35 (5 min)

- now that we have a database, the next layer are object stores (like tables or collections)

  - these can hold anything cloneable (basically everything except things like functions - any data)

- no schema, no SQL

- `onupgradeneeded` is fired when the database is opened or the version is increased, both of these are a result of `open`

- demo in browser, we now have an object store

### Stu: 19-Stu_Creating_Object_Stores

- 1035-50 (15 min)

### Ins: Review

- 1050-55 (5 min)

- We create the object store in the `onupgradeneeded`

### Ins: 20-Ins_Creating_Indexes

- 1055-11 (5 min)

- object stores are schema-less and do not support native search

- to query data we need to first create an index on one of the keys (like a column)

- `createIndex(indexName, keyPath)` method to create indexes, it takes two arguments.

  - The `indexName` is what you use to access the index when querying.

  - The `keyPath` is the actual name of the "column."

- show in chrome

  - ask: why didn't it show up?

    - because I already had a db with that version, it doesn't think there was any change

    - demo deleting the db then seeing it

    - change index name, refersh (nothing happens)

    - update db version

    - error, object store exists

    - wrap with `db.objectStoreNames.contains('toDoList')`

  - either delete the db or update the version to see these results

  - When we click on the database tab, we can see that we now have an empty object store called `todoList`. Inside our `todoList` object store we now have a `timestamp` index that we can use to query on.

- ask: what is an index?

### Stu: 21-Stu_Creating_Indexes

- 11-1110 (10 min)

### Ins: Review

- 1110-15 (5 min)

### Ins: 22-Ins_Adding_Getting_Data

- 1115-20 (5 min)

- ask: what do you think is next?

- let's add data!

- the API is a bit janky, takes a lot of code to do this

- `keypath` in the `createObjectStore` to allow querying the store

  - we use this when retrieving the data later

- `db.transaction(['storeName1', 'storeName2'], 'readwrite')`

  - opens a transaction request

  - all CRUD operations must occur within a transaction to maintain consistency

- We use `get` object store method to query by `keyPath`.

- We use the `getAll` object store method to query by indexes.

- go through the code via debugging in chrome

- Next open your developer tools console to show the data being returned from our `get` and `getAll` methods.

  - What is a keyPath?

    - A keyPath gives us a way to query our column's data.

  - What is an index?

    - An index is another way to more efficiently and specifically query for data.

### Stu: 23-Stu_Adding_Getting_Data

- 1120-35 (15 min)

### Ins: Review

- 1135-40 (5 min)

- We add data to our object stores with the `add` method.

- We can add a `keyPath` argument when we create our object stores that let's us query.

- We use `get` object store method to query by `keyPath`.

- We use the `getAll` object store method to query by indexes.

- Open [23-Stu_Adding_Getting_Data]:

  - We first create an object store and pass it the optional `keyPath` argument of `listID` that we can use to query with.

  - We then create an index on our `todoListStore` with `createIndex`, passing it an `index` of `statusIndex` and a `keyPath` of `status`.

  - We then simply use the `add` method to add records to our object store.

  - Next, we make a get request to our object store using the `get` method, which queries by `keyPath`.

  - Finally we make another get request with `getAll` and query by our `index`.

  - Querying by `index` is more efficient than by `keyPath`. When creating a schema, if you know the data you will be searching for most often, creating an `index` for that data is ideal.

  - When querying with the `getAll` method, what argument do you pass it?

    - The value of the index you want returned

### Ins: 24-Ins_Updating_Data_With_Cursors

- 1140-45 (5 min)

- demo this in chrome debugger

- `openCursor` to get a cursor request

- `continue` to move to the next document

- ask: why would we want to use cursor?

  - to iterate through all of our documents

### Stu: 25-Stu_Updating_Data_With_Cursors

- 1145-12 (15 min)

### Ins: Review

- 12-05 (5 min)

- live code if time is available

- otherwise debug in chrome

### BREAK

- 1205-45 (40 min)

### Intro 26-Stu-Mini-Project

- 1245-50 (5 min)

- demo the project

  - when online it syncs with the database

  - when offline it uses indexeddb

  - when it goes back online it syncs up with the db

### Stu: 26-Stu-Mini-Project

- 1250-150 (60 min)

### Ins: Review

- 150-2 (10 min)

- Treat this review as a question and answer session to help students who might be stuck, since there are 10 minutes allotted.

- Open [26-Stu-Mini-Project] in your IDE and walk students review the solved code, letting the students ask questions about the key methods and functions they had to write.

  - `onupgradeneeded`

  - `saveRecord()`

  - `checkDatabase()`

  - `saveRecord()`

  - `onsuccess`
