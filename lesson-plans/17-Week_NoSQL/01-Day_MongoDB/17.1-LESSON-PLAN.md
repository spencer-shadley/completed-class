# 17.1 - Masters of MongoDB

## Overview

In this class, you will introduce the concept of the NoSQL database with MongoDB, go over its pros and cons compared with MySQL, and ultimately detail all of the required steps to employ MongoDB in future projects.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and explain the differences between SQL and noSQL databases.

- Install MongoDB and Robo 3T.

- Create a Mongo database.

- Perform basic CRUD actions on their Mongo database.

### Ins: Slides

- 630-40 (10 min)

### 00-Stu-Install-MongoDB

- 640-7 (20 min)

- demo running `mongod`

  - tell them this starts a daemon in the background to handle mongo requests

- run `mongo` to start the mongo shell which connects to `mongod`

- Show Robo 3T

- look at activity 0 for installation instructions

### Ins: 01-Ins-Create-Insert-and-Find

- 7-20 (20 min)

- feel free to follow along

- we're going to use all the CRUD operations for mongo

- now that we know CRUD, it's really just translation

- run `cd C:`, `mongod` and then `mongo`

- `db` (show we default to `test` db)

- `use farm`

- `show dbs` (doesn't create stuff until we insert data)

- ```js
  db.animals.insert({
    name: 'spot',
    species: 'cow',
    food: ['grass', 'hay']
  });
  ```

- ask: tell me how to insert another animal

- `db.animals.find()`

  - NOTE: the MongoDB `_id` was created automatically.

- Add `.pretty()`

- `db.animals.find({ species: 'cow' })`

- `db.animals.find({_id: ObjectId("someId")})`

- `db.animals.update({ name: 'spot' }, { name: 'Speckle' });`

- `db.animals.update({ name: 'Speckle' }, { $set: { sound: 'moo!' } });`

- `db.animals.remove({ name: 'Speckle' });`

- `db.animals.drop();`

### Stu: 02-Create-Insert-and-Find

- 720-30 (10 min)

- try out the CRUD operations

### Ins: Review

- 730-45 (15 min)

- split screen terminal and `README.md`

  ```js
  use classroom
  db.students.insert({name: 'Spencer', os:'Win', favoriteColor: 'blue', hobbies:['Coding', 'Programming'] })
  ```

- Find everyone

  - `db.students.find()`

- Find a person by name

  - `db.students.find({name: 'Spencer'})`

- All Windows users

  - `db.students.find({os: 'Win'})`

- Find a person who uses windows and has a favorite color of blue

  - `db.students.find({os: 'Win', favoriteColor: 'blue'})`

- Delete all mac users

  `db.students.remove({ os: 'Mac' });`

- BONUS - operators

- Find by entry in an array

  ```js
  db.students.findMany({ hobbies: { $in: ['Coding'] } });
  ```

- Update the "name" field to a nickname (show that without set this just replaces the entry)

  - `db.students.update({name: 'spencer'}, {$set: {name: 'Spence'}})`

- Add a new hobby

  ```js
  db.students.update({ name: 'Spencer' }, { $push: { hobbies: 'Developing' } });
  ```

- Drop the students collection

  - `show collections`
  - `db.students.drop()`
  - `show collections`

- Drop the database

  - `db.dropDatabase()`

### Ins: 03-Ins-Operators

- 745-45 (00 min)

- expand on operators

- can skip if really needed

- follow activity instructions side-by-side

### Stu: 04-Stu-Operators

- 745-8 (15 min)

- Try out these operators

### Ins: Review

- 8-10 (10 min)

- Open [04-Stu-Update-Delete-and-Drop/Solved/README.md] in your IDE and walk students through the queries.

- Go back to your classroom database.

  ```js
  db
  use classroom
  ```

- Add multiple students at once

  ```js
  db.students.insertMany([
    {
      name: 'Spencer',
      os: 'Win',
      favoriteColor: 'blue',
      hobbies: ['Coding', 'Programming']

### BREAK

- 810-25 (15 min)

### Ins: 05-Ins-Sorting-In-Mongo

- 825-35 (10 min)

- Let's sort stuff!

- split screen the readme

- `1`: ascending

- `-1`: descending

### Ins: Introduction to MongoJS

- 835-40 (5 min)

- normally we don't work in the terminal, let's get this into JavaScript code with `MongoJS`

- `MongoJS` emulates the official MongoDB API and wraps `mongodb-native`

- Ask for a volunteer to guess how you might use `MongoJS`: `find`, `insert`, `remove` and `sort`.

- These methods are nearly identical to running them in the `mongo` shell so they will feel comfortable with MongoJS

### Stu: MongoJS Sorting

- 840-55 (15 min)

- Open [06-Stu-MongoJS-Sorting/Solved/server.js] solution on your machine, and run `server.js` with Node.

- Visit the different routes in your web browser to show students the results:

  - `/` will display a simple hello world message.
  - `/all` will display JSON with every animal in your zoo collection.
  - `/name` will display JSON with every animal, sorted by name.
  - `/weight` will display JSON with every animal, sorted by weight.

- Next direct students towards the unsolved version located in [06-Stu-MongoJS-Sorting/Unsolved/server.js] and have them complete the activity.

# Instructions

- Create four routes that display results from your zoo collection

  - 0: Root: Displays a simple "Hello World" message (no mongo required).
  - 1: All: Send JSON response with all animals
  - 2: Name: Send JSON response sorted by name in ascending order
  - 3: Weight: Send JSON response sorted by weight in descending order

- Tell your students to ask you or a TA for help if they have any questions while working on the assignment.

### Ins: Review

- (5 min)

- Ask the students how the activity went, and encourage anyone who had trouble using it.

- Remember, even if it is similar to using the `mongo` shell, this is still the first time they've used this node package.

- Open [06-Stu-MongoJS-Sorting/Unsolved/server.js] on your machine and ask for volunteers to help guide you through the activity.

- After each route, start the `server.js` file and use your web browser to check the route.

- If it works, great! If not, ask the student who gave the answer if you had mistyped something (since they gave the answer they'll probably be able to point out the error better than anyone).

### Stu: MongoJS CRUD

- (20 min)

- Open [07-Stu-Mongo-CRUD/Solved/server.js] on your machine and demonstrate the solved version of the app by creating, updating and deleting a few notes.

  - Note that to update a note you have to click on it's title, then update the form and submit.

- After demoing, direct students to the unsolved activity located in [07-Stu-Mongo-CRUD/Unsolved/server.js]

# Instructions

- Update the [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file to include the following six routes.

- You can see a list of methods available to you here. [https: github.com/mafintosh/mongojs#api](https://github.com/mafintosh/mongojs#api).

- Save a note to the database's collection `POST: /submit`

- Retrieve all notes from the database's collection `GET: /all`

- Retrieve one note in the database's collection by it's ObjectId `GET: /find/:id`

- Update one note in the database's collection by it's ObjectId `POST: /update/:id`

- Delete one note from the database's collection by it's ObjectId `DELETE: /delete/:id`

- Clear the entire note collection `DELETE: /clearall`

### Ins: Review

- (10 min)

- Open [07-Stu-Mongo-CRUD/Solved/server.js] and walk students through the code.

### Ins: Demonstrate Robo 3T

- (5 min)

- Instruct your students to open the application. They should see a window like this:

  - They should hit the connect button. Do the same to show students what comes next.

  - `/all` will display JSON with every animal in your zoo collection.

  - `/name` will display JSON with every animal, sorted by name.

  - `/weight` will display JSON with every animal, sorted by weight.

### Stu: Robot 3T Practice

- (5 min)

- Instruct students to drop their classroom collection and create a new one.

# Instructions

- ONLY USE ROBO 3T FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT

- In a new classroom collection, re-enter your `name`, `os`, and `hobby` info array.

  - This should be entered using the `right-click -> Insert Object` method.

- Next, Slack out your `name`, `os` and `hobbies` into the classroom chat.

- As students enter their BSON info into slack, insert it into your database.

- By the end of the exercise, you should have every student's information in your classroom collection.

- Direct students to the next activity located in [08-Stu-Robo-3T].

```md
# Robot 3T

- In this activity, you will practice using Robo 3T.

## Instructions

- Drop your classroom collection and create a new one.

- In a new classroom collection, re-enter your `name`, `os`, and `hobby` info array.

  - This should be entered using the `right-click -> Insert Object` method.

- Next, Slack out your `name`, `os` and `hobbies` into the classroom chat.

- As students enter their BSON info into slack, insert it into your database.

- By the end of the exercise, you should have every student's information in your classroom collection.
