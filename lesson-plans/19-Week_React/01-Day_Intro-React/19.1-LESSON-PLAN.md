# 19.1 - Intro to React, Components and JSX

Today we are short on time, try to go quickly

## Architecture Overview

- This is the PWA HW

- Code is pretty much already given in different activities, just combine it

- make sure you understand the budget tracker app well then build off of it

- how do we make something installable?

  - Manifest

  - Service Worker

    - register

    - install

      - precache

    - activate

    - fetch

      - cache vs online strategies

      - workbox makes this part really easy

    - mostly can base off of other activities

### Ins: Go Through Slides

- 630-45 (15 min)

- this will be a small and gentle intro to react. We will continue building on it for three weeks

- it is a new syntax which will take some time to get used to

- like with most things in class, React is massive and we can't cover all of it. We will give you an introduction and you can self-research to gain further mastery. Consider each of the things we cover the tip of an iceberg.

### Partners: 1-Stu_DocumentationQuestions

- 645-7 (15 min)

- setup and research for react

- The first task in this assignment instructs them to install Create React App if they haven't already. Instructional staff should be walking around offering assistance with the research questions, as well as the installation process (which should be fairly straight forward).

- Have them work with one another on answering the questions listed using the React.js documentation. Have them divide up the work the questions among teammates, and discuss answers afterwards rather than going through them all one at a time together.

- Let them know that going through the official documentation may feel challenging at first, but encourage them to revisit it again after todays class. Once they have a basic understanding of React, they should find that the React documentation is some of the best there is for any library.

- Encourage them to take this task seriously as it will help them gain a basic sense of things.

### Ins: Review

- 7-10 (10 min)

- `create-react-app` is a way to easily setup a starter react project that we'll be using

- Scroll through the documentation as we go over the below

- Declaritive vs imperative programming paradigms

  - Declaritive

    - expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow

    - draw me a cat - I don't care how you draw it, I just want a cat

    - SQL is an example

    - focuses on the what

  - Imperative

    - uses statements that change a programâ€™s state

    - imperative programming is like a lesson on how to draw a cat - put the brush down gently, make three strokes for whiskers, etc.

    - focuses on the how

  - React declares that something should be drawn, not how to go update the DOM

    - think of what you want to display, rather than how you want to display it

- Component based

  - A component is a small chunk of UI

  - demo [Tableau Online](https://us-west-2a.online.tableau.com/t/alpodev/authoring/Anime/Trends?:jsdebug=true) with the React dev tools on the data tab

    - draw a component tree

    - start collapsed and show how it corresponds

  - It's a way to break down our apps into many smaller re-usable pieces

    - it's much easier to reason about when things are nice and small

    - also testable and re-usable

  - Encapsulation

    - React is built using encapsulated components (manage their own internal state, others don't need to know about it)

- JSX

  - https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/e9ua4n/im_sure_some_of_you_will_react_to_this/

  - https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html

  - Babel compiles it to normal JavaScript with strings and objects

    - `const greeting = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>`

    - `const greeting = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, World!");`

    - https://babeljs.io/repl#?browsers=&build=&builtIns=false&spec=false&loose=false&code_lz=DwCwjAfAzgJsD04JA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&timeTravel=false&sourceType=module&lineWrap=true&presets=es2015%2Creact%2Cstage-2&prettier=false&targets=&version=7.9.0&externalPlugins=

- Props

  - The immutable (cannot change) properties of an application

  - example: text in our buttons (demo in tableau online)

- Stateful

  - kind of like a model, there is some state that represents the application. Given state (and props) you can deterministically produce a component. The state is the "current" and "changing" part of the application.

  - example: focus state of a button

### Ins: Demo Create React App

- 710-24 (14 min)

- demo component updating, only a small part of the DOM changes

  - let's us think about what the UI should look like, not how to change it from one state to another

  - timer example

- `npx create-react-app react-practice`

  - show output

  - Facebook made jest, it is their default testing here

- `npm run start`

  - open http://localhost:3000

  - starts react in development mode

- `src`

  - babel looks at this to combine into `bundle.js` using webpack (show with network)

  - execution begins at `src/index.js`

    - `React.StrictMode` is like 'use strict' - it adds checks like deprecated usages

    - we will ignore service worker for now just for the sake of simplicity

    - see how we are importing an `App` component and rendering that

      - if we go there and change something it will auto-reload (webpack)

- `public`

  - it already has nice things like a favicon, manifest and robots

  - `index.html` has a `#root` element

    - this is where our app is rendered into (see `index.js`)

- we'll run this script dozens of times in this class and will add to the `src` directory

### Partners: 02-Stu_HelloReact

- 724-39 (15 min)

- now that we have a basic understanding of react, you're going to dissect some example code and answer questions about it

### Ins: Review

- 739-49 (10 min)

- `index.js`

  - `<App />` is JSX

  - we're using the `ReactDOM` util to render our app into the root element found in `public/index.html`

- `App.js`

  - Could rewrite as functional component

    ```js
    function App() {
      return <HelloReact />;
    }
    ```

  - add basic HTML in JSX, but we have to wrap it in a single exported element

    ```js
    class App extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <HelloReact />
            <p>hi</p>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

- `HelloReact.js`

  - We need to import `React` to use JSX

- `index.js`

  - rewrite this to be inlined

  - As we'll see a bit later, ES2015 modules allow for finer tune control over what is exported and imported from a module. For now just compare the new syntax to what they're used to.

### Stu: 03-Stu_HelloDiv

- 749-59 (10 min)

- In this activity students will write a React component that displays their name and some information about themselves.

### Ins: Review

- 759-804 (5 min)

- Make sure everyone understands the following concepts:

  - `HelloDiv` is exported and rendered inside of `App`.

  - `App` is exported and then rendered inside of `index.js` as the first argument to the `ReactDOM.render` method.

  - The second argument to the `ReactDOM.render` method is the real DOM element that our React application should be rendered inside of.

  - `HelloDiv`, like most components we'll write, is a JavaScript function; it returns some JSX.

        - Some students may have an error when they tried to render multiple JSX elements. Explain that _normally_, we aren't able to render multiple JSX elements from a component without an enclosing parent tag.

    - This may seem strange at first, but if we think about our component in the same way we think about any other JavaScript function, it makes perfect sense: a JavaScript function can only return one value. To have separate groups of JSX being returned outside of a parent element would be like trying to write a JavaScript function that returns multiple different variables at once.

  - **Note:** With the release of React 16, we _do_ have another option for returning multiple JSX elements from a component: we can return an array.

    - Based on your students' level of understanding and comfort so far, you may want to skip over explaining this as there aren't any activities or use cases we'll run into where understanding this pattern is required.

    - If you choose to proceed, the `HelloDiv` component can also be written as follows:

    ```js
    function HelloDiv() {
      return (
        (<h1>Hey guys! I'm a header!</h1>),
        (<h2>Things I like!</h2>),
        (
          <ul>
            <li>Peas</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Love</li>
          </ul>
        )
      );
    }
    ```

### BREAK

- 804-19 (15 min)

### Ins: 04-Ins_HelloBootstrap

- 819-29 (10 min)

- let's add bootstrap to the project

- `HelloBootstrap.js`

- load this and show that bootstrap is not showing up

  - ask: why isn't bootstrap working?

  - ask: where do you think I should put it?

  - `index.html`

    - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>`

- back to `HelloBootstrap.js`

  - ask: any differences from normal HTML?

    - `className` instead of `class` (class is reserved in JavaScript)

      - there a few other small differences we'll come across later

### Stu: 05-Stu_HelloBootstrap

- 829-39 (10 min)

- Add bootstrap to the starter code, try making three separate components

### Ins: Review

- 839-843 (4 min)

### Ins: 06-Ins_JSXVariables

- 843-855 (8 min)

- run the app - doesn't look like anything is new

- `src/components/JSXVariables.js`

  - We can write comments inside of our JSX using JavaScript's multi-line comment syntax inside of curly braces. If we were to try and write regular JavaScript comments inside of our JSX, the code would break.

  - In addition to being able to write comments inside of the curly braces, we can also embed JavaScript expressions. This works similarly to the `{{ }}` double curly braces we've worked with in Handlebars.

    - We use the `name`, `num1`, and `num2` variables inside of our JSX code. Try updating the `name` variable and demonstrating to the class how when the page refreshes, we have the updated name being rendered.

    - Rendering `name` is a fairly simple example, but we can also evaluate entire expressions inside of JSX curly braces. Point out how we're producing random numbers and reversing `name` further down below.

      - Explain that an expression is any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expressions that evaluates to a single value. In other words, anything we can assign to a variable or pass as a function argument is an expression. This doesn't include loops or conditionals, which we have various ways to deal with that we'll go over later.

    - Explain that these curly braces are how we get data from our JavaScript code into the views React renders.

      - Point out that this is different from jQuery or vanilla JavaScript where we have to call methods to explicitly set the inner text of an element.

    - Remind everyone that when we were working with Handlebars, we couldn't write raw JavaScript code inside of the `{{}}` double curly braces. Instead we had to use the Handlebars templating language which only exposed certain functionality. Since what we're writing inside of the JSX curly braces is just regular JavaScript, we have access to the full power of JavaScript inside of our views.

### Stu: 07-Stu_JSXVariables

- 855-905 (10 min)

- try out JSX

### Ins: Review

- 905-10 (5 min)

- `JSXVariables.js`

### Ins: 08-Ins_CSSDemo

- 910-920 (10 min)

- let's add CSS into our app

- we can import CSS into components

- `Header.js`

  - an internal style tag is created and added to the document

  - show `Header.css` (class names match)

  - demo in chrome debugger (start at react component)

- ask: how many times has your project gotten messy because there's just CSS everywhere?

  - splitting into smaller style files helps with this organization

- `Card.js`

  - inline style

    - benefits

      - scoped to the components they're attached to

      - JS logic can make the style more dynamic

  - it's a nice object, instead of a string

  - demo in chrome debugger (start at react component)

### Stu: 09-Stu_StyleProp

- 920-30 (10 min)

- switch the starter code from using external stylesheets to internal stylesheets
