# 19.3 - Forms, Conditional Rendering & React Router

### Ins: Intro and 17-Ins_FormsDemo

10-15 (15 min)

- today's topics

  - use forms

  - react lifecycle

  - perform AJAX requests

  - conditional rendering

  - React Router

  - mini-project as last hour

- 17-Ins_FormsDemo

  - form with React

  - demo first

  - ask: what might my props and state be?

    - props: none

    - state: firstname, lastname

  - `onChange`

  - `state`

- remove `onChange` listeners to demo that it stops updating

  - like `onClick` event

- computed property name `[name]` allows using the actual name looked up ([MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Computed_property_names))

### Stu: 18-Stu_FunWithForms

- 1015-30 (15 min)

- add a password to the form we just went over

### Ins: Review

- 1030-40 (10 min)

- just added another state member for password

### Ins: AJAX Demo

- 1040-55 (15 min)

- demo the app

  - searches giphy for whatever is typed into the input

- start with React component tree

- `SearchResultContainer`

  - `componentDidMount`

    - runs after the first render

    - the component and its children have been rendered and mounted to the DOM

    - http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/

    - there are a few lifecycle events we can hook into

    - the constructor is synchronous, the ajax call is async - might not be ready in time

    - `render` is another lifecycle event

- `SearchForm`

- `SearchResultContainer`

### Stu: 20-Stu_AJAX

- 1055-1110 (15 min)

- demo the result first

- query the omdb api for a movie

### Ins: Review

- 1110-25 (15 min)

- start with component tree view

  - `OmdbContainer`

    - owns logic for searching for movies

    - only stateful component

      - helps cleanliness

    - renders `Container`, `Row`, `Col`, `MovieDetail`, `SearchForm`

    - `componentDidMount`

      - runs after the first render

      - the component and its children have been rendered and mounted to the DOM

      - http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/

      - there are a few lifecycle events we can hook into

      - the constructor is synchronous, the ajax call is async - might not be ready in time

      - `render` is another lifecycle event

    - `searchMovies` uses the axios API to make AJAX requests

- `Container`, `Row`, `Col` - very simple

- `SearchForm` then `MovieDetail`

- try to keep as many components stateless as possible

  - a few components will contain state, perform business logic and be considered "container" components

- react allows hooking into various lifecycle methods

- react is only concerned about the view layer

### Stu: 21-Stu_ConditionalRender

- 1110-30 (20 min)

- demo clicking links results in different components being rendered

- this might require googling, try to conditionally render a component based on some conditions

### Ins: Review

- 1130-40 (10 min)

- click around with the react component tree open

- `PortfolioContainer`

  - our stateful container which keeps track of the current page

- can quickly show page components, they are very simple

### Break

- 1140-1220 (40 min)

### Ins: 22-Ins_IntroReactRouter

- 1220-40 (20 min)

- as we saw in the last example, it's common to have different pages with different corresponding components

- in the previous example it was cumbersome and non-link-shareable

  - what if we were Amazon with thousands of products that can't be shared

- a library called `react-router` has this built-in

  - basically like conditionally rendering components based on a route

- show `react-router-dom` in `package.json`

- demo app

  - url changes as we click around

  - learn goes to `contact/learn` and adds a nested component

  - open a URL in a new tab

- `App.js`

  - Point out how we're importing two components from the `react-router-dom` library: `BrowserRouter` and `Route`. Explain that by importing `BrowserRouter` _as_ `Router`, we're renaming this component to be `Router` inside of this file. Renaming this component is totally optional but a convention used in the React Router documentation.

  - Explain that the `BrowserRouter` (`Router`) component is like the brain of our application's router. We wrap our entire application with this component - without it, none of the routes we define will work. On its own `Router` doesn't do anything to our application's styles or functionality. It's primarily for setting up any additional configuration we want to give our React Router via props we attach. The default configuration it provides is fine for our purposes, so we don't need to do anything other than include it.

  - Inside of `Router` component, we have a `div` element wrapping our other components. Explain that the `Router` component can only have a single child element, so we wrap the rest of our application's code inside of a `div`.

    - Feel free to demonstrate the code breaking if you were to remove this `div`. Let students know that if they forget this rule, they'll receive a helpful error message reminding them that `Router` can only have one child element.

  - Point out the following:

    - We no longer need a `PortfolioContainer` component. In the previous example, the `PortfolioContainer` component was responsible for keeping track of our application's `currentPage` state. Now that we have React router handling this, we no longer need to do so ourselves.

    - We're importing the `Route` component from `react-router-dom`. Explain that at a minimum, this component expects a `path` prop and a `component` prop. When the pathname in the browsers address bar matches the `Route` component's `path` prop, the specified component will be rendered.

    - We're specifying that the `NavTabs` component should always be rendered regardless of the application's current route.

    - Below the `NavTabs` we render a `Route` component. When the `path` is set to "/", render the `Home` component.

      - Point out the `exact` prop present on this `Route` component. Explain that this means this `Route` will _only_ render the `Home` component when the path is _exactly_ "/".

        - Demonstrate what happens if we were to remove this `exact` prop and navigate to any of the other pages.

        - Both `Route` components would render. Explain the `path` prop means "render if the route _starts_ with this path". By adding the additional `exact` prop, we're saying that we only want this `Route` to render if the path is an _exact_ match.

        - Explain that unlike routes in express, React Router will, by default, render routes inclusively rather than exclusively. This means if two or more routes match the same path, both will render.

    - Go into the `NavTabs.js` file and walk through this component's new code.

      - We're importing a `Link` component from the `react-router-dom` library and using that in place of regular anchor tag elements.

      - Explain that the `Link` component navigates our application to another route when clicked, just like an anchor tag. But the `Link` component prevents our entire React application from reloading when we go to different URLs. Instead, only the components that need to change will change.

      - The `Link` component also has some additional functionality, such as allowing us to pass props into the component rendered at the specified route if we wanted to.

      - We can treat this component exactly the same as we would a regular anchor tag, except we'd use the `to` prop rather than `href` to specify the path we want to navigate to.

      - Explain that we can utilize `window.location.pathname` in order to get the path we're currently on if we need it. In our case we're using it to determine which `a` element should have the "active" class and be highlighted.

  - Go back to the `App` component and once more explain how each `Route` component is rendering its component. Inform students that the major takeaway here is that when the path in the address bar matches the path specified on a `Route` component's `path` prop, the component passed in is rendered.

  - Explain that now we're going to go over the code that renders the nested `/contact/learn` route.

  - Open up the `src/components/pages/Contact.js` and go through the code.

        - Point out that the start of the component is nothing out of the ordinary - we're just rendering some lorem ipsum.

    - Further down below, we're utilizing another `Route` component which only renders the `Learn` component if the route matches `${props.match.url}/learn`.

    - Explain that any component we render using the `Route` component (such as this `Contact` component) is automatically passed a `match` prop object containing information about the `Route` component that rendered it. We can access `props.match.url` to get the path which rendered this route.

      - Using `props.match.url` might be a good idea as opposed to just hard coding `/contact/learn` into the `path` prop (which would also work). This way if we update a route higher up in our application, we don't need to update all of the other nested route `path` props.

### Stu: Pupster App

- 1240-145 (65 min)

- In this activity students will work with partners to create a full React application from scratch complete with routing and AJAX requests to the [Dog Ceo API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

### Ins: Review

- 145-2 (15 min)

- As a class, go over [23-Stu_PupsterApp/Solved] version of the previous activity. The most important points to cover are:

  - How each route is rendering each component.

  - How we used axios to create an API helper file.

  - Our use of `componentDidMount` to make the initial call to the dog.ceo API for the `Discover` component.

- Take a few moments to answer any lingering questions.

This Week

This week we covered our intro to React! This completes the last piece of our MERN stack. React is a front-end library that we use for our Views which changes how we think about writing front-end code in several ways. Two of the most important ways to re-think our front-end is breaking down our page into smaller pieces (components) and to stop thinking about how to transform from one UI state to another state. Given props and state, you tell React how it should render the UI and that's it, not how to update from an old state to a new state.

The main React concepts we covered are:
React - our new View. Resources: Documentation, Getting Started, Components, Intro to React Tutorial, Components and Props, Thinking in React, Cheatsheet, YouTube Overview
create-react-app - easily create a starter React template built using webpack. Resources: Documentation
props - the immutable "properties" of a component. These are the data points that will never change during the lifetime of a component, for example, the theme of a button or the url of an icon in a card. Resources: W3Schools
state - data which change over the lifetime of a component. Use this to capture things like what a user has currently typed or what dropdown item they have selected. Resources: Visual Guide to State, W3Schools, setState
lifecycle - every React component will go through the React lifecycle. We can perform different actions at different points in the lifecycle just like we did with service workers. The three parts of the lifecycle we covered are the constructor, render and componentDidMount Resources: Diagram, documentation, example walkthrough, W3Schools, React Lifecycle Methods and When to Use Them
react-router - easily conditionally render components based on the URL. Resources: YouTube tutorial (first half is what we covered, second half we will cover next week), React Router in 5 Minutes, documentation, React Router Training, React Router Guide

To solidify what we've learned, I highly recommend checking out the references resources above. We are going to build on all of these going forward so it's important you understand these fundamentals.

Next Week

We are going to build more complex React applications. These applications will have complicated state that, with our existing tools, would be difficult to manage. To help manage these more complex stateful applications we are going to discuss state management in React. To deal with complicated state we have a few options that we will go over. The first, and most straightforward, is "lifting state up". For components that share common state, move the state they would like to share to the lowest common ancestor component (closest component to each of them.) We will also go over React Hooks which provide new tools to help manage complex applications. We will cover useState, useEffect, custom-hooks and useContext.

Tuesday
Common React Hooks
useState to access state from a functional component
useEffect to perform actions which will create side effects, such as manipulating data in a database
custom-hooks for more flexibility

Saturday
Redux-style state management. We won't have time to fully cover Redux but we will cover some of the core ideas behind it that React has adopted.

Resources to get ahead:
YouTube tutorial on Redux - we won't cover Redux but the ideas behind it are useful and Redux is very popular in industry

Next week will move at a faster pace than this past week. I highly recommend going through the resources ahead of time for each day.
