# 19.2 - Props, Lists, and Stateful Components

Finishes 10 minutes early

### Ins: Go through Slides

- 630-40 (10 min)

### Ins: 10-Ins_PropsDemo

- 640-55 (15 min)

- overview: props, child-parent relationships, render components with data, component state

- draw a button

  - there are probably lots of these

  - ask: what changes for each button instance?

    - once the button is made does it ever change?

- our components often take props

- each instance of a component has properties that will always be true (invariants)

  - demo [Tableau Online](https://us-west-2a.online.tableau.com/t/alpodev/authoring/Anime/Trends?:jsdebug=true) with the React dev tools on the data tab

    - show that each button has a prop icon

- this enables having one component class that can handle different inputs

- `Alert.js`

  - functional component

  - accepts `props` as a parameter

  - updates the bootstrap classname for an alert using `props.type`

  - our component has children we want to render, available via `props.children`

  - https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html

- `App.js`

  - ask: how do you think the props are passed in? who controls this?

  - passed as attributes for the props

  - children is the content of the component

  - change the type to `success`

  - change the children to a different message

  - props use a unidirectional flow - parent to child (predictable and easy to debug)

- ### Stu: 11-Stu_PropsCalculator

- 655-705 (10 min)

- write a component that accepts props, performs arithmetic and renders the result

### Ins: Review

- 705-710 (5 min)

- `Math.js`

- `Calculator.js`

### Partners: 12-Stu_PropsReview

- 710-25 (15 min)

- refactor existing code using props to be more DRY

### Ins: Review

- 725-35 (10 min)

- `FriendCard`

  - reusable component

  - Point out that we use the `props` argument to access all of the values passed into the `FriendCard` component.

  - called `index.js` so that we can import the directory, which requires a file called `index.js` inside

    ```js
    import FriendCard from './components/FriendCard';
    ```

    ```js
    import FriendCard from './components/FriendCard/FriendCard';
    ```

- `App.js`

  - normally the data would dynamically come from an AJAX call

  - `./friends.json`

### Stu: 13-Stu_ComponentMap

- 735-45 (10 min)

- utilize the map method in order to render JSX from an array of objects

### Ins: Review

- 745-55 (10 min)

- `Basic`

  - `List.js`

    - array of `JSX.Element`s

    - `key`

      - ask: why is this here?

      - prop to enable React to efficiently know what part to re-render, needs to be unique

        - index of array could have bugs if the order changes

      - warns if not included, but does work

- `Bonus`

  - `const notPurchased = props.groceries.filter(grocery => !grocery.purchased);`

### BREAK

- 755-810 (15 min)

### Ins: 14-Ins_BasicState

- 810-25 (15 min)

- these have all been stateless functional components ("dumb components")

  - this is really common and should be a goal (easy testing, debugging, reasoning, reusability)

- sometimes things change - they are dynamic and stateful

- React state differs from regular variables because they are an explicit input into how a UI should render

  - update state or props and it re-renders

- state is managed by the component itself

- props are managed by the parent component

- draw an input field

  - props might be things like width, color, etc.

  - state would be what is currently typed in it

- demo counter app

- `Counter.js`

  - must use arrow to correctly bind `this` to the component

### Stu: 15-Stu_DecrementCounter

- 825-35 (10 min)

- add a decrement button

### Ins: Review

- 835-45 (10 min)

- start with basic

- bonus just refactors the component into two pieces

### Stu: 16-Stu_FriendRefactor

- 845-905 (20 min)

- refactor the Friends List to a class component and state

### Ins: Review

- 905-20 (15 min)

- Demonstrate the completed application in the browser. Point out how we can remove friends by clicking the red x icon.

  - Briefly go over the syntax for writing a class component. Be sure to point out the constructor method, how we set the application's initial state. Explain that when defining object properties with ES6, if the object's key and value have the same name, we can omit the colon - this is just an optional shorthand syntax.

- Point out how we bind the `removeFriend` method inside of the constructor. Ask the class: how does this method remove a friend?

- Point out how inside of the `removeFriend` method we use the filter method to create a new `friends` array from `this.state.friends`. We include only friends with an `id` property **not** equal to the `id` being received into this method. Then we use the `setState` method in order to set `this.state.friends` equal to the new filtered friends array.

  - Explain that when we update our component's state by removing one of the friend objects, our component re-renders itself. On the new render, `FriendCard` components are created for each object in `this.state.friends`, which no longer includes the deleted friend. This then triggers our component to re-render, now minus one friend.

  - Remind students that in React, we never modify state directly, but we create new state instead. If the state we're modifying is an array, we'll often use the filter or map method.

- Scroll down to the code where we map over `this.state.friends` and render a `FriendCard` component for each element.

  - Point out the props being passed, in particular, the `id` and the `key` prop. Remind the class that whenever we map over a list of data and return JSX, React wants us to give each element a unique `key` prop. React uses this value internally to help it efficiently render and re-render components from arrays of data.

    - Explain that the `key` prop is unusual because it's used by React but isn't actually available for us to use inside of the component we pass it to. We pass the friend `id` in as a separate prop because we'll need it inside of the `FriendCard` component.

- Open up the `FriendCard` component.

  - Point out how we've attached the `onClick` handler to the "remove" span. When clicked, it calls the `removeFriend` method and passes in `props.id`.

- Ask the class: Why do we have the `removeFriend` handler wrapped inside of another function?

  - Explain that since our event handlers need to be callbacks, we normally can't pass in arguments without invoking them right away. But by wrapping the `removeFriend` method in an another function, we can pass the `id` prop into the inner `removeFriend` method. When the span is clicked, it calls the anonymous callback function, which then calls the `removeFriend` method with the friend's `id` as an argument.
