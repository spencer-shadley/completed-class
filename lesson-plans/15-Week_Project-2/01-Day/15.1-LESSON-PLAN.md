# 15.1 - Linting & Projects

## Overview

- Today's class will be focused on introducing students to project 2 requirements, introducing them to the concept of JavaScript linting and continuous integration with Travis.

- Students will begin work on their second project

- Praise students for making it to their second group projects.

- Leverage the TAs to help any groups lagging behind during the lesson. We want to give students as much time to brainstorm project ideas as possible.

- Instructors / TAs, take a few moments before class to review the presentations posted on this link: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe80S_8KApqOTw-2-b-sgzTwwWImepoii>. Do not share these with students as they are Rutgers Specific - however, use the insight you gain in watching these videos to understand what's possible.

### Ins: Welcome Students

- (before class) write on board "sit with your groups"

### Ins: Project 2 Slides

- 633-43 (10 min)

### Stu: 01-Stu_Create-Repository

- 643-53 (10 min)

### Ins: Linting Slides + Overview

- 653-58 (5 min)

- ### Stu: 02-Stu_No-Lint-Example

- 658-703 (5 min)

### Ins: Review

- 703-08 (5 min)

- ### Partners: Eslint Example

- (5 min)

- In this activity students will use eslint to fix issues with the calculator app from the previous activity.

- Refer to `16-project-2/01-Activities/03-Stu_Eslint-Example`, which contains the following instructions:

# Instructions:

```
* Install the [VS Code Eslint Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

* Open the Unsolved directory and run `npm install` from your terminal to install dependencies.

* Now open Unsolved/example.js in your code editor. If you were able to complete the previous steps correctly, you should see red annotations under different parts of the code. Hovering over each displays a popover with an eslint rule being broken.

* Work to fix each part of the annotated code.

* **Bonus**:

* Try changing the quote style to enforce single-quotes instead of double-quotes.

* **Hints**:

* If you're unsure about what an eslint rule is asking for, type it into Google for examples.
```

### Ins: Review

- (5 min)

- Demonstrate how hovering over the annotations in the `example.js` file brings up the eslint rule being broken in the file.

  - Explain that eslint is an npm package that must be installed. The VS Code extension gives us the annotations over our files so we know what to fix in the moment, but only works if we have the eslint npm package installed.

- Additionally eslint provides a cli tool we can use. Run the following command in your terminal to demonstrate this:

  ```
  npm run lint
  ```

- If you haven't already gone ahead and fixed all the lint errors in the `example.js` file, you should receive errors in the console. Scroll up to see the specific eslint errors and their line numbers.

- Ask the class: "Where do you think the the eslint rules are being set?

  - The `.eslintrc.json` file.

- Demonstrate the `.eslintrc.json` file for the class. Explain that this file contains the rules we want eslint to enforce for us. A list of eslint rules and how to use them can be found at [eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

  - Eslint also includes the ability to share configs. Companies like Google and AirBnB create and publicly share their own configurations based on style guides used at their companies.

  - Students can look into how to use these if they wish, but they may find them to be much more restrictive than the simple one we're using now.

- Stress that changing conventions used in a project is now as easy as changing an eslint config. If the team decide they would prefer to indent 4 spaces instead of 4 or would prefer single quotes over double quotes, all we need to do is change a rule in the eslint config.

  - Being able to do this so easily helps us stay productive and minimize distractions. Without a linter, getting the entire team on board with and using a new convention could be a much more tedious and stressful process.

- Suggest that students use at least the basic eslint config provided for them in their projects. ### Ins: Introduce Travis CI Slides

- (5 min)

- Explain to the class that linters aren't very helpful if some group members choose to ignore their rules.

- Explain that in the next activity we're going to set up Travis CI (Continuous Integration).

  - Travis will prevent any code from being merged into master that doesn't pass the linter.

  - Travis will run a check on any new branches PR'd against master. This check may take a minute, but you will only be allowed to merge the code if the lint passes. Otherwise whoever made the PR will have to fix their code and try again.

- ### Stu: Travis Setup

- (10 min)

- In this activity students will add Travis CI to their projects.

- Instructional staff should be walking around answering questions and making sure groups can complete the activity.

- Refer to `16-project-2/01-Activities/05-Travis-Setup`, which contains the following instructions:

# Instructions:

```
* Only the owner of the project repo should complete this activity, other group members should watch.

* **Part 1**: Protecting Master

* Before we can set up Travis, we must configure the project repo to protect the master branch.

* Navigate to the repo's page, then click the "Settings" tab.

* Select "Branches" from the left sidebar.

* Under "Branch protection rules", choose "master" from the drop-down.

* Check off the following options:

  * "Protect this branch"

  * "Require pull request reviews before merging"

  * "Include administrators"

  * "Require status checks to pass before merging"

  * "Require branches to be up to date before merging"

* Click "Save changes"

* **Part 2**: Add Travis

* Navigate to <https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci>.

* Select the option to "Set up a new plan" and choose the $0 "Open Source" plan when prompted.

* Click "Install it for free" and then on the next page click "Complete order and begin installation".

* On the next page select the radio button that reads "Only select repositories".

* From the "Select repositories" drop-down, choose your project repo.

* Click the "Install" button to complete the process.
```
