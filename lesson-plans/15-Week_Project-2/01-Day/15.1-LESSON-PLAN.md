# 15.1 - Linting & Projects

## Overview

- Today's class will be focused on introducing students to project 2 requirements, introducing them to the concept of JavaScript linting and continuous integration with Travis.

- Students will begin work on their second project

- Praise students for making it to their second group projects.

- Leverage the TAs to help any groups lagging behind during the lesson. We want to give students as much time to brainstorm project ideas as possible.

- Instructors / TAs, take a few moments before class to review the presentations posted on this link: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe80S_8KApqOTw-2-b-sgzTwwWImepoii>. Do not share these with students as they are Rutgers Specific - however, use the insight you gain in watching these videos to understand what's possible.
