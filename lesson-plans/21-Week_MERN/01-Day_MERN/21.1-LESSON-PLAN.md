# 21.1 - MERN

## Architecture talk

- probably start over and use existing stuff as a reference

- use `create-react-app`

- components go into `components` directory by convention

---

### Ins: Welcome Class

- 630-35 (5 min)

- skip local slides

- objectives

  - connect the front-end create-react-app to the backend of express

  - more practice with react router

  - deploy this full-stack to heroku

- lots of boilerplate will be used

- mostly more practice with existing concepts

- historically react has been the most difficult part of the course

- Welcome your students back to week 2 of React!

### Ins: https://react-review.netlify.com/

- 635-50 (15 min)

- react review

### Ins: 01-Ins_Mern

- 650-705 (15 min)

- so far it's been a development server with create-react-app

  - that server really just does live reloading

  - webpack can be used to produce static assets for serving

- we obviously need a backend for a full application

- `create-react-app` using express backend

- each activity has a lot of boilerplate react express code which can be used for hw, projects and activities

  - loosely based on https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo

- show file structure (expand client)

  - what's weird here?

  - two `package.json`s

    - different dependencies for client and server

  - this would normally be a complicated build process but `create-react-app` and `webpack` make it really easy

    - front-end is still `create-react-app` with a server that supports live reloading

    - other is a normal node/express backend

- `npm i` is needed in both directories

- live reloading server is still on port 3000

- `client/package.json`

  - proxy - part of create-react-app (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/)

    - forwards any unknown requests (non-static-assets) to the given server

- draw out the proxy behavior

- `package.json`

  - `scripts` are pretty complicated now

    - really just shortcuts for commands we would run frequently

    - this makes it easy to run the right commands in the right order

    - `start`

      - trace it through the scripts

      - demo

    - `build`

      - this uses webpack to bundle our code to static assets that can be deployed

      - won't use during development but our deployments will

      - demo

    - `heroku-post-build`

      - tells heroku to run this

- there are no more instructor demos. You already know everything needed and the rest is review and practice with using a full-stack application.

### Stu: 02-Stu_Recipes

- 705-20 (15 min)

- complete a recipe finder app by adding code to render a list of recipes from an AJAX request

### Ins: Review

- 720-30 (10 min)

- `npm install` to install dependencies on both

- `npm start` to start the app and go to http://localhost:3000

- changed code was client-side, server side already working

- `App.js`

  - go to `RecipeListItem` part of `render`

- `RecipeList`

  - just wraps the children

- `RecipeListItem`

  - props

    - thumbnail default to placeholder

notes:

    - If the rel=noreferrer attribute is added to a link, no referrer information will be leaked. The ultimate aim is not to pass the HTTP referrer header when a person clicks on the hyperlink. If no information is in the header, then it will not be tracked by analytics tools.

    - we use rel=”noreferrer noopener” to block the use of the window.opener JavaScript object because once the window.opener stops working, then a tab can’t control another tab.

    - https://www.reliablesoft.net/noreferrer-noopener/

- let's add persistent storage

### Stu: 03-Stu_AJAXBooks

- 730-40 (10 min)

- add functionality to retrieve books from a db

- just shows them on the right side for now

### Ins: Review

- 740-50 (10 min)

- `client/src/pages/Book.js`

  - AJAX calls are made from the `API` module so we import it

  - when the component is mounted we make a call to get our books

  - even without knowing much about how the backend works we are able to successfully build our front-end by calling their APIs. This was true when we used third party APIs as well.

  - once the call completes we update our state to with those books

  - the list of books is conditionally rendered on if books have been found

- we'll make the form functional in the next activity

### Stu: 04-Stu_AJAXFormDelete

- 750-805 (15 min)

- add functionality to save and delete books

- demo adding a book and deleting a book

### Ins: Review

- 805-15 (10 min)

- `client/src/pages/Books.js`

  - start at `return`

  - `onChange` prop added to update the state when user types

    - before showing `handleInputChange`, ask: how can we distinguish which input was being changed?

    - how will we be able to get what the user typed? (the `event.target.value`)

  - `handleFormSubmit`

    - avoid refresh

    - use `API.saveBook` to save the book

  - `deleteBook`

    - we need to know which book to delete so we pass in the id

    - API deletes the book

### BREAK

- 815-30 (15 min)

### Stu: 05-Stu_ReactRouter

- 830-50 (20 min)

- In this activity students will add React Router to the React Reading List in order to add a books `Detail` page and a `NoMatch` 404 page. Students will need to look up how to use route params with React Router.

### Ins: Review

- 850-905 (15 min)

- `client/src/App.js`

  - `Switch` renders the first matching `<Route>`

    - common to use as a `404` handler (will come back to this)

  - `/` and `/books` render `Books` (demo)

  - `/books/:id` renders `Detail`

    - supports route parameters just like express

    - values are exposed in `props.match.params`

- `Detail.js`

  - show `props.match.params.id`

- `App.js`

  - `NoMatch` when none of the other routes match (404)

### Stu: 06-Stu_ReactRouter

- 905-20 (15 min)

- deploy this application

- you can use the solved version of this activity

### Ins: Review

- 920-25 (5 min)

- deployment can go wrong more than ever now, test deploying early
