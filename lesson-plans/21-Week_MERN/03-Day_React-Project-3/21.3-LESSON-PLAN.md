# 21.3 - React.js / Project #3 (10:00 AM)

## Overview

By the end of class everyone must submit their project plans and breakdown

## Review

- 10-11:15 (75 min)

## Algo

### Stu: 2-research-algorithms

- 1115-25 (10 min)

### Everyone Do: Students Share Responses

- 1125-30 (5 min)

### Ins: Algorithm Definition

- 1130-40 (10 min)

- An algorithm is a well-defined series of steps to perform an action. This could be steps to making a sandwhich, sorting an array, counting birds or generating a password.

- It's usually easy to get the right answer but hard to get the right answer quickly, securely, without using much memory, high code quality, etc.

  - optimizing for only one of these is very easy

  - how can you solve the same problem better?

- We've been using algorithms pretty much the entire class.

## Search

### Stu: 3-for-loop-search

- 1140-50 (10 min)

- search an array for a number

### Ins: Review

- 1150-12 (20 min)

- Explain the solution

- This is a "linear search"

- demo https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html

- In the worst case we need to search the entire array

- If we double the length of the array we double the amount of time it takes to search. Tripling triples the time, etc.

  - linear means there is a linear increase in the amount of time we have to wait for the algorithm to finish

- ask: what is the minimum number of iterations it would take to find a random number (1)

- ask: what is the maximum number of iterations it would take to find a random number (length of array)

- at this scale, the perf is negligible

- let's time it

- there are lots of libraries and APIs to time code execution. We're goinng to use `benchmarkjs`

- benchmark just means testing how long an algorithm takes to run

- this library will execute code several times and take an average to avoid anomolies

- don't worry about any of the syntax or this specific library. If you need to benchmark performance you can google it.
