- An algorithm is a well-defined series of steps to perform an action. This could be steps to making a sandwhich, sorting an array, counting birds or generating a password.

- It's usually easy to get the right answer but hard to get the right answer quickly, securely, without using much memory, high code quality, etc.

  - optimizing for only one of these is very easy

  - how can you solve the same problem better?

- We've been using algorithms pretty much the entire class.
