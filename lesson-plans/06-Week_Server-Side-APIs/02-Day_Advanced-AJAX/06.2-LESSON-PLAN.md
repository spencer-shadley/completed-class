`Summary: Complete activities 5-11 in Unit 6`

### Instructor Do: API and AJAX Slidedeck

- 630-42 (12 min)

- Open deck

### Students Do: 05-Bujumbura

- 642-57

### Instructor Do: Review 05-Bujumbura

- 657-702

 - (5 min)

  - Ask: how would you find the weather in `London`. (Answer: Just change the `queryURL`)

- Ask students why all of the code needed to be inside the `.then` function

### Instructor Do: 10-WorkingMovieApp

- 702-07

 - (5 min)

- Building towards this

- Allows retrieving movie custom movie data

### Students Do: 06-MovieJSONDump

### Instructor Do: Review 06-MovieJSONDump

### Students Do: 07-MovieButtonLayout

- 722-47 (25 min)

- The button part of the larger activity - dynamically add buttons

### Instructor Do: Review 07-MovieButtonLayout

- 747-57

 - (10 min)

  - The `renderButtons` function is looping through the `movies` array and creating a jQuery element for each.

  - Point out that the `.on("click")` event tied to the button is what triggers re-rendering of the movies array

  - Ask students why the `#buttons-view` needed to be emptied in the `renderButtons` function (Answer: otherwise content will get replicated each time you click a button).

### Students Do: 08-LogMovieName and 09-ClickJSON

- 757-817 

- (20 min)

- [08-LogMovieName]

  - Adds an alert to the dynamic buttons activity with the movie name

- [09-ClickJSON]

  - Clicking a movie will display the relevant JSON

### Instructor Do: Review 08-LogMovieName and 09-ClickJSON

- 817-27

 - (10 min)

* Review [08-LogMovieName]

* Review [09-ClickJSON]

* In your discussion, be sure to point out

  - How we used data attributes to retrieve the "name" of each movie;

    - Also point out how we used an alternative `.on("click")` event. Instead of using an `.on("click")` event associated with our buttons, we created one that was associated with the `document`. This was necessary to ensure that the dynamically created elements were bound to jQuery.

  - Demonstrate how the app would function with both sets of event syntax.

### BREAK

- (15 min)

- offer candy to Githubblepuff, Ravenclosure, SlytherindentYourCode and then GryffinDOM

### Students Do: 10-WorkingMovieApp

- 842-907 (25 min)

### Instructor Do: Review 10-WorkingMovieApp

- 907-12

 - (5 min)

* Point out how this application's code basically consists of an AJAX call which retrieves data from the OMDb API, parses it, then displays it inside of an HTML element.

### Instructor Do: Review 11-BandsInTownApp (OPTIONAL)
