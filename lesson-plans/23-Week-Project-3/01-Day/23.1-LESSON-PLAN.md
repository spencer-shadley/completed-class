- CSS transitions

  - transitions are good for simple actions

  - don't allow complex behavior such as different behaviors at different points

  - good when there are two definite states you want to seamlessly transition between

  - add

    - `transform: rotate(90deg);`
    - `transition: width 2s, background-color 1s, transform 2s;`

- CSS animations

  - An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

  - You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.

  - To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.

  - Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

  - To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element

  - It is also possible to use percent. By using percent, you can add as many style changes as you like.

  - has in-between states with keyframes

  - animation will play immediately (not just on a transition such as hover)

- demos

- Project 3 work
