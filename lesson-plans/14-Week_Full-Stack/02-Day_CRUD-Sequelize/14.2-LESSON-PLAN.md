# 14.2 - Getting In The CRUD with Sequelize

### Ins: Pulse Check and Sequelize Review

- 630-40 (10 min)

- we will be introducing methods to update and delete records and validate using sequelize

- today we will be converting an app to use sequelize

- ask: how are people liking sequelize?

  - What is Sequelize?

    - An ORM designed for Node that lets users handle complex SQL database queries with JavaScript methods, rather than typing out SQL code.

  - What is a Sequelize model?

    - A representation of a table as a JavaScript object that Sequelize uses to help expedite the coding of data queries.

### Ins: TodoList Demo

- 640-50 (10 min)

- demo the final TODO list

- there is an existing todo list app that was using a simple ORM, we're going to make it more functional by adding all CRUD actions

### Warm Up: 07-ORM-To-Sequelize

- 650-720 (30 min)

- starts with `orm.js`, remove all references and setup sequelize

### Ins: Review

- 720-30 (10 min)

- `server.js`

  - `sync` our models to create the tables before starting our server
  - running `node server` should create the Todos table (because of sync)

- `api-routes.js`

  - `models` are required here and will be used in the next excercise using `findAll` and `create`

### Partners: 08-Sequelize-Create-Read

- 730-45 (15 min)

- add sequelize routes for GET (`findAll`) and POST (`create`)

### Ins: Review

- 745-55 (10 min)

- `api-routes.js`

  - `db.Todo.create` which takes an object with the values

- run the app

- note: only `dataValues` is sent back to the client

### Partners: 09-Sequelize-Update-Delete

- 755-20 (25 min)

- now add delete and update functionality

- start with a demo of the solved version

  - click "X" to delete
  - click a note to update it

### Ins: Review

- 835-50 (15 min)

- Talk about how researching documentation is an important skill

  - I did still add `supplemental/SequelizeCRUDActionsCheatSheet.pdf`

- `config.json`

- `api-routes.js`

  - DELETE

  - PUT

C - create, insert into, POST
R - findOne/All, select, GET
U - update, update (update table set column=value where condition), PUT
D - destroy, delete from table where condition, DELETE

### BREAK!

- 820-35 (15 min)

### Ins: Validations

- 850-905 (15 min)

- we are restricting text to be `Sequelize.STRING` but allowing lots of other stuff

  - `null` - by default allows null, can restrict with `allowNull: false` option

  - what about empty strings? minimum or maximum sizes? email only?

  - we could add checks on the client side but someone with knowledge of developer tools could circumvent this

  - ask: how can we add this? any ideas?

    - it's built-in to sequelize!

### Partners: 10-Sequelize-Validations

- 905-20 (15 min)

- try researching the built-in validations to add to the TODO app

### Instructor: Review

- 920-30 (10 min)

- these validations will need to be looked up as needed, don't memorize

- can call `model.validate()`

  - also on create, update and save

- talk about constraints - things like `unique: true` or `allowNull: false` which are defined at SQL level and the DB will throw errors

- extras

  - `isInt: { msg: "Must be an integer number of pennies" }`

  - `isIn: { args: [['en', 'zh']], msg: "Must be English or Chinese" }`

  - ```js
      customValidator(value) {
        if (value === null && this.age !== 10) {
          throw new Error("name can't be null unless age is 10");
        }
      })
    ```

  - model wide validation

    ```js
    class Place extends Model {}
    Place.init(
      {
        name: Sequelize.STRING,
        address: Sequelize.STRING,
        latitude: {
          type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
          validate: {
            min: -90,
            max: 90
          }
        },
        longitude: {
          type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
          validate: {
            min: -180,
            max: 180
          }
        }
      },
      {
        sequelize,
        validate: {
          bothCoordsOrNone() {
            if ((this.latitude === null) !== (this.longitude === null)) {
              throw new Error(
                'Either both latitude and longitude, or neither!'
              );
            }
          }
        }
      }
    );
    ```

### End

- Inform the class that we've just covered a lot of ground today. We've learned everything and more needed to complete this week's homework assignment. If they feel they haven't caught onto everything, encourage them to continue practicing, check out the solution files, and browse through the Sequelize documentation. Of course, they can also talk to you or a TA between classes for one-on-one advice.

### Bonus

- Deploy to Heroku with JawsDB
