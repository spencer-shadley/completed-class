# 14.3 - Getting Associated with Relations

### Ins: Sequelize Review

- 10-15 (15 min)

- today will be all back-end, you will not need to change any front-end code

- we will iteratively build an application to learn about relations in sequelize

  - app is a blog with a CMS

* Ask students what we went over in the last class.

  - What CRUD methods did we learn? Ask students to briefly try and name as many as they can.

    - `findOne`: finds a single record from a table
    - `findAll`: finds all records from a table
    - `create`: creates a new record in a table
    - `update`: updates a record or records in a table
    - `destroy`: deletes a record or records from a table

  - What does "where" do? What might we use it for?

    - It's an object we can pass in to a Sequelize query. It lets us be more specific about which records we want to target.

  - What are validations and/or flags?
    - Optional built in Sequelize helpers that let us do things like set up default values for columns, or make sure text is within a certain length before inserting it.

### Ins: Demo 12-Blog-CRUD

- 1015-25 (10 min)

- we will be building up to this

### Warm Up: 11-Post-Model

- 1025-40 (15 min)

- add a model, it won't be functional yet though

### Ins: Review

- 1040-55 (15 min)

- show `config.json`

- `post.js`

  - draw table on whiteboard and then map it to an object

- `server.js`

  - `{force: true}`

- demo the table being created when synchronize is run

  ```sql
  USE blogger;
  DROP TABLE Posts;
  ```

- Start the server and show the class how a Posts table was created for us in MySQL Workbench.

  - What is the difference between DataTypes.STRING and DataTypes.TEXT? We haven't used this until just now.

  - STRING is the equivalent of varchar (255) in MySQL. Useful for storing relatively small values.

  - TEXT is a virtually unlimited amount of storage for characters. We might use this if we needed to store something larger or of unknown size.

  - This isn't something they need to memorize, a quick search of `Sequelize Data Types` will bring this right up.

- Navigate to the `server.js` file and point out the section of code where we sync our database.

  - Point out the `{ force: true }` object inside of the sync method. What is this doing?

    - This means that whenever we sync our database (whenever we start our app), we want to drop our tables and recreate them with any updated schemas. This is useful during the development process when we're experimenting with our database structure. During today's activities we'll be changing our models quite a bit, so this is useful to have. We'd want to remove this before deploying to a production environment. (otherwise we'd lose all of our data whenever our app starts)

### Ins: Introduce CRUD Activity

- 1055-11 (5 min)

- Open the `12-Blog-CRUD/Solved` directory inside and start the server.

- Demonstrate to students again how in the solved copy we're able to retrieve all posts, retrieve posts of a certain category, create new posts, update posts, and delete posts.

- Inform students that now they'll be setting up the additional back-end functionality for this code inside of the `api-routes.js` file.

- Again, stress that they won't need to (and shouldn't) modify any of the client side code to make this work.

### Partners: CRUD Activity

- 11-20 (20 min)

### Everyone Do: Review the CRUD activity

- 1120-35 (15 min)

- Go through the solution in `12-Blog-CRUD/Solved` together. Have students explain to you what each method does, what the "where" attribute is doing in the methods using it.

### Ins: Demo Post Author Relationships

- 1135-50 (15 min)

- `12-Blog-CRUD/Solved` and `14-Post-Author-Joins/Solved` are the solution files it would be most beneficial to become familiar with before class. These are what students will be building the back-end for throughout class.

- Open the `14-Post-Author-Joins/Solved` application in Chrome and demonstrate how the app's functionality has changed some.

  - We've gotten rid of categories, but now we have a second model, Authors. In this example, Authors have Posts, and Posts belong to Authors.

  - Demonstrate how when we first start the app and try and create a new post, we're directed to the `author-manager.html` page, where we must first create an Author.

  - Demonstrate how after creating an Author, we now have the option to create a new Post for that Author.

  - After creating a new Post, we are redirected to the blog page where we see the Author's name by that Post.

  - After creating a few Authors with Posts, navigate to `localhost:8080/api/posts` to show students what the data returned fro the API looks like now. Each Post has a nested Author object. This lets us easily grab information about the Author who wrote the Post with very little work on the client side.

- Answer any questions about the app's functionality here, or why we might want to include the Author with a Post object when doing a GET request.
- Concentrate on making sure students understand what the app is supposed to do, but try not to go into too much detail about the implementation here. We're going to talk about how we can restructure our models and queries to make this happen over the next few exercises.

### Partners: Discuss Relations

- 1150-55 (5 min)

Slack out the following image and instructions and have students discuss with their partners.

**Image**: [`3-Relationship-Exercise`](Images/3-Relationship-Exercise.png)

**Post**

**Author**

# Instructions

- How can we restructure our database tables if we wanted the ability to form a relationship between a Post and an Author?

- What would we have to change with these tables to make that possible?

  - Which table would have a foreign key and why?
  - What would that look like?

- Remember, an Author can and will have multiple Posts, but a Post will only have a single Author.

- Assume we won't be making a third table.

### Everyone Do: Discuss Relations

- 1155-12 (5 min)

- As a class discuss together the previous activity.
- Have any volunteers explain their solutions to the class.
- We're not so much looking for "the right" answer here, since there are multiple ways to create relations between tables, but we do want them to understand the solution we're going to be going with.
- We're going to have a foreign key for the Author ID on the Posts table because:

  - It would allow us to have multiple Posts all pointing to the same Author.

  - We could make the foreign key a NOT NULL column. This way we could restrict a Post's creation if there is no Author.

Show students the image below or slack it out to illustrate what this might look like:

## BREAK

- 12-40 (40 min)

### Ins: Introduce Sequelize Associations

- 1240-45 (5 min)

- Explain to the class that what we went over in the last activity is considered a `belongsTo` association, as well as a `hasMany` association in Sequelize. These are some of the most common types of associations.

  - A Post **belongsTo** an Author.
  - An Author **hasMany** posts.

- This may be confusing at first, so we're going to do an exercise to hopefully help make this more clear. This exercise will have some unfamiliar syntax, so instructors and TA's should be walking around offering assistance.

### Groups Do: Sequelize Associations

- 1245-105 (20 min)

- Slack out the following directory and instructions:

  - **Folder:** `13-Post-Author-Association/Unsolved`

# Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to modify the Post and Author models so that they are associated with eachother.

1. Open the directory slacked out to you.

2. Run `npm install`

3. Open the `config` directory and update the `config.json` file's `development` object to match your own local MySQL database.

4. Navigate to the `post.js` file.

5. You will need to set an `associate` property to the `Post` model after it's defined. There's an example of this type of association being done here:
   <https://github.com/sequelize/express-example/blob/master/models/task.js>

- This may take a few tries to implement correctly in your own Post model (There's a lot of curly braces there!). You can verify your code works by starting your node server and then checking MySQL Workbench. If the Posts table now has a foreign key of AuthorId, you were successful.

**Bonus**: If you complete the exercise before time's up, navigate to the author.js file and add a **hasMany** association from the Author model to the Post Model. An example of this type of association can be found here:
<https://github.com/sequelize/express-example/blob/master/models/user.js>

**Note** After this activity we have just one more step to complete the app and get it fully functioning.

### Ins: Review

- 105-25 (20 min)

- Open the solved version of the previous exercise `13-Post-Author-Association/Solved` in your editor and navigate to the posts.js file.

- Explain to the class that this while this may be some unfamiliar syntax, we don't need to perfectly understand how it all works to use it. A lot of Sequelize code is boilerplate we need not concern ourselves too much with. Nonetheless, it can be helpful to have some understanding:

- We set the `associate` property of the `Task` model equal to a function which has a `models` parameter.
- Inside of this function we run the `Post.belongsTo` method and pass in some configuration.
- The object's only key is `classMethods` and it's value is another object.
- This inner object has a key of `associate`.
- We specify that we want to associate our `Post` model with `models.Author`.
- We run the **belongsTo** method on Posts and take in models.Author as an argument.
- We're adding a flag to our foreign key (AuthorId) saying this cannot be null. In other words, it won't let us create a Post without an Author.
- **Explain that for the most part they can create an association just by copying and pasting this code. There's no need to worry about memorizing it.**
- Briefly go over the **hasMany** association in the Author model. This was part of the bonus and isn't actually required to put a foreign key on the Post model, but it's VERY helpful as it helps us easily perform joins whether we're doing a find on Posts, or a find on Authors. This will be more clear in the next exercise!
  ![Author Associate](Images/8-Author-Associate.png)
- There are other types of associations we can do with Sequelize, but belongsTo and hasMany are some of the most common and what we'll be using here.

  - <http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/docs/associations/> Sequelize's docs are very thorough when it comes to the different types of relations that are available.

- We're almost done! While we've set up our relations, we haven't actually specified that we want to return joined data to the user inside of our queries, therefore our app won't work as expected quite yet.
- Inform students that in the next activity we're going to direct them to a section of Sequelize's documentation to see if they might be able to figure out how we need to change our queries to make this work.

### Groups Do: 14-Post-Author-Joins

- 125-40 (15 min)

# Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to modify our find queries in both post-api-routes.js and author-api-routes.js to use Sequelize's "include" option. We can use "include" to say that we want to return associated data.

1. Open the directory slacked out to you

2. Run `npm install`

3. Open the `config` directory and update the `config.json` file's `development` object to match your own local MySQL database.

4. Navigate to the `post-api-routes.js` file.

5. Add the "include" option to the queries specified in the comments. This is a feature called "eager loading". We want to "include" the Author model. Examples can be found here:
   <http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/tutorial/models-usage.html#eager-loading>

6. Navigate to the `author-api-routes.js` file and add the "include" option to the queries specified in the comments. Here we want to "include" the Post model.

7. If successful the application should now be fully functional. After you create a few Authors with a few posts, try navigating to either `localhost:8080/api/posts` or `localhost:8080/api/authors` to make sure the JSON returned for both routes includes all of the data.

**Hint**: The "include" key goes on the same options object as the "where" attribute we've been using. Examples can be found at the link supplied.

### Instructor: Review and Dismiss Class

- 140-2 (20 min)

- Show students how by just adding `include: [<models>]` as an option in our query we can easily get the associated data.

- Create a few quick posts and demonstrate how when we navigate to `localhost:8080/api/authors` we get all of the author data with their Posts attached. Demonstrate the same for `localhost:808/api/posts` and note how the same is true in the reverse.

- In MySQL, this is what's known as a "left outer join". We can do others with Sequelize, but this gives us very convenient access to both pieces of associated data.

removed header line- Congratulate the class on getting through one of the most challenging topics in the course.

- Encourage students to continue to review the in class exercises and to hang on to them for reference.
- Encourage students to review the [TrilogyTV Sequelize + Handlebars Review Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDgpYNqItmc&index=1&list=PLgJ8UgkiorCnbVc-ZiCqgm3dw7Cvrewq2)
