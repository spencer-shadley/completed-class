# 14.3 - Getting Associated with Relations

### Ins: Sequelize Review

- 10-15 (15 min)

- today will be all back-end, you will not need to change any front-end code

- we will iteratively build an application to learn about relations in sequelize

  - app is a blog with a CMS

* Ask students what we went over in the last class.

  - What CRUD methods did we learn? Ask students to briefly try and name as many as they can.

    - `findOne`: finds a single record from a table
    - `findAll`: finds all records from a table
    - `create`: creates a new record in a table
    - `update`: updates a record or records in a table
    - `destroy`: deletes a record or records from a table

  - What does "where" do? What might we use it for?

    - It's an object we can pass in to a Sequelize query. It lets us be more specific about which records we want to target.

  - What are validations and/or flags?
    - Optional built in Sequelize helpers that let us do things like set up default values for columns, or make sure text is within a certain length before inserting it.

### Ins: Demo 12-Blog-CRUD

- 1015-25 (10 min)

- we will be building up to this

### Warm Up: 11-Post-Model

- 1025-40 (15 min)

- add a model, it won't be functional yet though

### Ins: Review

- 1040-55 (15 min)

- show `config.json`

- `post.js`

  - draw table on whiteboard and then map it to an object

  - `DataTypes.STRING` is `varchar(255)`

  - `DataTypes.TEXT` is virtually unlimited

  - Google "Sequelize Data Types" to find more

- `server.js`

  - `{force: true}`

    - drops table if it exists. Why is this helpful? Dangerous?

    - you can see the drop table in the server output

- demo the table being created when synchronize is run

  ```sql
  USE blogger;
  DROP TABLE Posts;
  ```

### Partners: 12-Blog-CRUD

- 1055-25 (25 min)

- Will be adding CRUD operations in `api-routes.js`

### Ins: Review

- 1120-35 (15 min)

- show `api-routes.js`

- talk about the flow of error validations

### Ins: Demo 15-Post-Author-Joins

- 1135-50 (15 min)

- no more categories

- added authors

  - when we first start to create a post we're redirected to `author-manager.html`

- ask: what do you think the relationship is between authors and posts?

  - one to many

  - authors have posts, posts belong to authors

- create a few authors and a few posts

  - show what the data looks like in network when clicking "manage authors"

    - array of authors

    - author has posts inside

  - on blog ("posts")

    - array of posts

    - post has authorId and author

### Partners: 13-relationships

- 1150-55 (5 min)

- discuss how you would recreate the tables such that we can form a relationship between these tables

### Ins: Review

- 1155-12 (5 min)

- foreign key for author id on posts table

  - this allows multiple posts pointing to the same author

  - should be not null (every post must have an author)

## BREAK

- 12-40 (40 min)

### Ins: Introduce Sequelize Associations

- 1240-45 (5 min)

- The relationships described earlier follow:

  - Post `belongsTo` Author
  - Author `hasMany` posts

- More examples

  - Team/player

    - Player belong to team
    - team hasMany players

  - Pizza slice / Eater
    - one to one
    - pizza hasOne(eater)
    - `Team.hasOne(Game, {as: 'HomeTeam', foreignKey : 'homeTeamId'});`

### Groups Do: 14-Post-Author-Association

- 1245-105 (20 min)

### Ins: Review

- 105-25 (20 min)

- a lot of this is abstracted, we need to understand simple relationships, not complicated sequel joins

- `post.js`

  - `Post.belongsTo(models.Author)`

  - `Post` is "source" and `Author` is "target"

  - by default it will connect using primary key of target and specified foreign key

    - can override with `targetKey` option and `foreignKey`

    - https://sequelize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/associations/

- `author.js`

  - what should we do when an author is removed?

    - options are RESTRICT, CASCADE, NO ACTION, SET DEFAULT, SET NULL

    - default is to set null for 1-1 and 1-many

    - default is cascade for n-m

    ```sql
      CONSTRAINT fk_name
          FOREIGN KEY (child_col1, child_col2, ... child_col_n)
          REFERENCES parent_table (parent_col1, parent_col2, ... parent_col_n)
          ON DELETE CASCADE
          [ ON UPDATE { NO ACTION | CASCADE | SET NULL | SET DEFAULT } ]
      );
    ```

### Groups Do: 15-Post-Author-Joins

- 125-40 (20 min)

- In our routes add join information

### Instructor: Review

- 140-2 (20 min)

- we can include additional models here

  - `include: [models]`

- this is a left outer join

- this was one of the hardest parts of the class - congrats!

- Encourage students to review the [TrilogyTV Sequelize + Handlebars Review Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDgpYNqItmc&index=1&list=PLgJ8UgkiorCnbVc-ZiCqgm3dw7Cvrewq2)

### Wrap up

- Start on your projects!

- After project 2 we will:

  - NoSQL (mongo)

  - PWA

  - React (three weeks)

  - Computer Science (data structures and algorithms)

  - project 3 (two weeks)

  - class is over!
