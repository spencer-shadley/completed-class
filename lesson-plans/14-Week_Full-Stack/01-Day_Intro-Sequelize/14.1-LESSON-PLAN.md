## 14.1 - The Sequel to MySQL

## Overview

### Ins: Intro

- 630-32 (5 min)

- We will cover sequelize today which makes interacting with databases much nicer

  - it's a Node ORM

  - this will require reading the documentation, stackoverflow, etc.

- Discuss the full week plan

  - Thursday we will cover more advanced sequelize by converting an app to use it

- It's okay if you don't nail everything, this is tough stuff. If you're not understanding something talk to us.

### 00-MVCDiagram

- 633-35 (3 min)

- draw the diagram on the whiteboard

  - add Express, MySQL, ORM, HTML, CSS, handlebars, etc. to the diagram (ask for each one, which one do they think it belongs to)

### Stu: 01-Chirpy-mySQL

- 635-55 (20 min)

- Review of `MySQL`

- Demo the app first

### Ins: Review

- 655-705 (10 min)

- go over structure

- explain `express.static`

  - middleware built-in to express
  - it will look at the given directory for static assets and server those when requests matching the path are reqeusted (relative path to the static directory)

- demo connecting with the "MySQL" VS Code extension

  - show the extension download
  - expand to the chirpy directory
  - select top 1000
  - highlight text and run it

### Ins: Introduce Sequelize

- 705-10 (5 min)

- Draw on board diagram of:

  - Node (server) <-> Sequelize (ORM) <-> MySQL (database)

- chirp table looked like this

  ```sql
    CREATE TABLE `chirps` (
    `id` INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
    `author` VARCHAR( 255) NOT NULL,
    `body` VARCHAR( 255 ) NOT NULL,
    `created_at` DATETIME NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
  );
  ```

- this can be visualized as a class

  ```js
  class Chirp() {
    constructor(id, author, body, createdAt) {
      this.id = id;
      this.author = author;
      this.body = body;
      this.createdAt = createdAt;
    }
  }
  ```

- each instance of this class (object) represents a record in the DB

- All an ORM does is figure out how to map between the two so that we don't have deal with SQL, instead we work with objects like we're used to

- We will be converting Chirpy to use Sequelize

### Partners: 02-SequelizeQuestions

- 710-25 (15 min)

- Research (Google Fu) sequelize and answer a few questions with a partner

### Ins: Review

- 725-35 (10 min)

- start from the unsolved version and ask the class (or if time is short copy/paste the answers)

### Ins: 03-Chirpy-Sequelize

- 735-50 (15 min)

- Students can follow along with this if they'd like

- Differences

  - `connection.js`

    - requires `sequelize`
    - uses a pool (creating a connection incurs overhead, the pool will resuse connections)

  - `models/chirp.js` now exists

    - a `model` is the "essence" of Sequelize

    - it is an abstraction of the table which inherits from `Model`

    - by default an `id` which is `NOT NULL` and auto-incrementing of `INTEGER` is included as the `PRIMARY KEY`

    - `sync` will tell sequelize that we're ready and it will figure out the right SQL to execute to create the table

  - `routes/api-routes.js`

    - `Chirp.findAll({})`

    - `Chirp.create`

### Stu: 04-StarWars

- 750-810 (20 min)

- Convert the given MySQL code to use Sequelize

- demo the app

### Ins: Review

- 810-20 (10 min)

### BREAK

- 820-35 (15 min)

### Stu: 05-SequelizeLibrary

- 835-9 (25 min)

- build the backend of a sequelize app

- demo the app

### Ins: Review

- 9-10 (10 min)

### Ins: 06-SequelizeCLI

- 910-25 (15 min)

- There is a CLI for sequelize as well

- go through `supplemental/SequelizeQuickStartGuide.pdf`

  - delete `models` and `config/config.json`

  - `npm i` from passport example (installs `sequelize` and `mysql2`)

  - `npm i -g sequelize-cli`

  - `sequelize init:config & sequelize init:models`

    - creates `config/config.json` and `models/index.js`

    - update `config.json` password

    - `index.js` initializes `Sequelize` to make using `Sequelize` much easier, look through if you're interested

      - checks which configuration to use (production, development)

      - runs all of our `models` through `Sequelize` producing helper methods, exporting an object to interface with Sequelize

  - create `models/user.js`

    ```js
    module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
      return sequelize.define('User', {
        email: DataTypes.STRING,
        password: DataTypes.STRING
      });
    };
    ```

  - update the DB to use these tables (sync) in `server.js`

    ```js
    const db = require('./models');
    db.sequelize.sync().then(() => {
      app.listen(PORT, () =>
        console.log(`listening on http://localhost:${PORT}`)
      );
    });
    ```

  - Demo results

    - run SQL query to create database specified in `config.js`

  * don't use the CLI for models, with more complex models it becomes difficult to use compared to writing by hand

- this is how we will setup Sequelize projects going forward, practice more outside of class

### Ins: Wrap Up and Dismiss

- 925-30 (5 min)

- Deploy `Sequelize` to Heorku using the `JawsDB` add-on pretty easily.

- Instructions are in `supplemental/SequelizeHerokuDeploymentProcess.md`
