## 14.1 - The Sequel to MySQL

## Overview

- **DO NOT HAVE STUDENTS CONNECT TO A REMOTE DATABASE WHEN DEVELOPING LOCALLY.** The correct process is described in `Supplemental/SequelizeHerokuDeploymentProcess.pdf`, and if you try to skip this, your students may not be able to work on activities or homework on your classroom's internet connection (also, using a remote database for local development is considered bad practice).

### Ins: Intro

- 630-32 (5 min)

- We will cover sequelize today which makes interacting with databases much nicer

  - it's a Node ORM

  - this will require reading the documentation, stackoverflow, etc.

- Discuss the full week plan

- It's okay if you don't nail everything, this is tough stuff. If you're not understanding something talk to us.

### 00-MVCDiagram

- 633-35 (3 min)

- draw the diagram on the whiteboard

  - add Express, MySQL, ORM, HTML, CSS, handlebars, etc. to the diagram (ask for each one, which one do they think it belongs to)

### Stu: 01-Chirpy-mySQL

- 635-55 (20 min)

- Review of `MySQL`

- Demo the app first

### Ins: Review

- 655-705 (10 min)

- go over structure

- explain `express.static`

  - middleware built-in to express
  - it will look at the given directory for static assets and server those when requests matching the path are reqeusted (relative path to the static directory)

- demo connecting with the "MySQL" VS Code extension

  - show the extension download
  - expand to the chirpy directory
  - select top 1000
  - highlight text and run it

### Ins: Introduce Sequelize

- 705-10 (5 min)

- Draw on board diagram of:

  - Node (server) <-> Sequelize (ORM) <-> MySQL (database)

- chirp table looked like this

  ```sql
    CREATE TABLE `chirps` (
    `id` INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
    `author` VARCHAR( 255) NOT NULL,
    `body` VARCHAR( 255 ) NOT NULL,
    `created_at` DATETIME NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
  );
  ```

- this can be visualized as a class

  ```js
  class Chirp() {
    constructor(id, author, body, createdAt) {
      this.id = id;
      this.author = author;
      this.body = body;
      this.createdAt = createdAt;
    }
  }
  ```

- each instance of this class (object) represents a record in the DB

- All an ORM does is figure out how to map between the two so that we don't have deal with SQL, instead we work with objects like we're used to

- We will be converting Chirpy to use Sequelize

### Partners: 02-SequelizeQuestions

- 710-25 (15 min)

- Research (Google Fu) sequelize and answer a few questions with a partner

### Ins: Review

- 725-35 (10 min)

- start from the unsolved version and ask the class (or if time is short copy/paste the answers)

### Ins: 03-Chirpy-Sequelize

- 735-50 (15 min)

- Students can follow along with this if they'd like

- Differences

  - `connection.js`

    - requires `sequelize`
    - uses a pool (creating a connection incurs overhead, the pool will resuse connections)

  - `models/chirp.js` now exists

    - a `model` is the "essence" of Sequelize

    - it is an abstraction of the table which inherits from `Model`

    - by default an `id` which is `NOT NULL` and auto-incrementing of `INTEGER` is included as the `PRIMARY KEY`

    - `sync` will tell sequelize that we're ready and it will figure out the right SQL to execute to create the table

  - `routes/api-routes.js`

    - `Chirp.findAll({})`

    - `Chirp.create`

### Stu: 04-StarWars

- 750-810 (20 min)

- Convert the given MySQL code to use Sequelize

- demo the app

### Ins: Review

- 810-20 (10 min)

### BREAK

- 820-35 (15 min)

### Stu: Sequelize Library

- 835-9 (25 min)

* In this activity, students will be building the backend of a Sequelize application.

* Open the Sequelize-Library solution `05-SequelizeLibrary` and demonstrate its functionality. Add a few books to the library then show students how we can search for books by title/author/genre, choose to view all books, or view short/long books.

* This app will require students to research more advanced sequelize querying. Urge students to use the Sequelize documentation to find these answers.

* Slack them the Sequelize Library skeleton directory `05-SequelizeLibrary` along with the following instructions:
  - Instructions
    - Create a `'sequelize_library'` DB.
    - Modify `'connection.js'` to include your MySQL user/database information.
    - In the `'models'` folder, modify the `book.js` file to create a book model. Further details can be found inside this file.
      - Your book model must include a title, author, genre, page numbers.
    - Modify `'api-routes.js'` using sequelize query methods to create the required routes.

### Ins: Go over Sequelize Library

- 9-10 (10 min)

* Go over Sequelize implementation. Focus on aspects of this activity that were new such as the advanced querying techniques as well as the CRUD operations. Inform students that this was a difficult activity and that we will spend more time with CRUD operations next class.

### Ins: Intro to Sequelize CLI

- 910-25 (15 min)

- Explain to students that we can also initialize Sequelize projects using the Sequelize Command Line Interface.

- This will allow us to quickly start new projects, take advantage of advanced Sequelize features, as well as work with multiple models more easily at scale an ultimately have to write less code as our project grows.

- Slack out the Sequelize CLI Skeleton `06-SequelizeCLI` as well as the `Supplemental/SequelizeQuickStartGuide.pdf` have the students follow along with you as you initialize a new project using the Sequelize CLI.

We will be using this method of setting up Sequelize projects going forward, so encourage students to practice with this guide before next class.

**NOTE**: The Sequelize CLI has a lot of functionality, including creating models via the CLI. **We will only be using be using the CLI to initialize an index.js file, and a config.json file**. Discourage model creation with the CLI (if it comes up at any point), as while this is fine for simple models, it will create far more trouble than it's worth later in the week when our models become more complex if students have never written them by hand before.

### Ins: Wrap Up and Dismiss

- 925-30 (5 min)

- Slack out the `Supplemental/SequelizeHerokuDeploymentProcess.pdf`. This describes the process for deploying a Sequelize application to Heroku and making use of JAWSDB.
