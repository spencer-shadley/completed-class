# 12.1 - Messing With MySQL

### Ins: Welcome Class

- 630-32 (2 min)

- SQL and MySQL and completely new and very different than what we're used to

- This the database part of our full stack development

- MERN getting closer

- Objectives

  - To have MySQL Workbench or Sequel Pro installed and running on everyone's computers

  - To create a localhost connection to a MySQL server and have everyone successfully connect to it

  - To successfully create, use, and populate a MySQL database with data

  - To successfully create, populate, and select data from a MySQL table

### Ins: Introduction to SQL and MySQL

- 632-37 (5 min)

- SQL > "structured query language"

- SQL is how we will communicate with databases

  - it's sort of like the servers API for databases to follow CRUD operations

- MySQL is open source to be installed on a server to allow SQL commands to affect the data on the server

- SQL updates structured data, stored in tables (like Excel / Google Sheets)

  - alternative are NoSQL databases for unstructured data (our "M" is actually Mongo)

### Ins: Creating a Localhost Connection Demo

- 637-47 (10 min)

- We don't have a server to connect to, instead we will setup "localhost connection"

  - This stores data locally as if it was an external server

- Create a new connection

  - Connection name: "local Istance MySQL"
  - Method: "Standard (TCP/IP)
  - Host: localhost
  - Port: 3306
  - Username: root (default)
  - "Store in Vault..." / "Store in keychain"
  - Schema: Empty

  - Click "Test Connection"
  - Double click the connection to open the SQL editor

### Everyone Do: 00-setup

- 647-52 (5 min)

- Install MySQL and workbench

### Stu: Creating a Localhost Connection

- 652-702 (10 min)

- extend if needed up to 30 min

- the UX of this program is bad and confusing

### Ins: Connections Vs. Databases

- 652-55 (3 min)

- Ask: have we made a DB? (no)

  - we have connected to a server which can hold databases, we still need to make one

  - connection is a road to an empty lot. Before populating the area we need to lay the foundation for houses (databases) and then build the houses (create tables)

- Show "SCHEMAS" tab on the left

  - only includes built-in sys database

### Ins: Creating a MySQL Database

- 655-7 (5 min)

- Create DB

  - Type `CREATE DATABASE animals_db;` (semicolon is needed)

    - creates a MySQL database on the server

  - Click the lightning-bolt icon in the editor to execute the code

    - At the bottom it updates with the result (success)

  - It's still not in our schemas though

    - right click in the schemas section and click "refresh"

    - database created!

### Ins: 01-animalsDB

- 7-10 (10 min)

- We now need to create tables within our database

  - draw on the whiteboard a database and some tables (animals db; people, crustacians, marsupials tables)

- add below db creation:

  ```sql
  USE animals_db;

  CREATE TABLE people (
    name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    has_pet BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    pet_name VARCHAR(30),
    pet_age INTEGER
  );
  ```

- run the code - error: `animals_db` already exists

  - MySQL data is persistent, it cannot be deleted or overwritten unless specifcally stated to

  - instead we can highlight the section of code we want to run, excluding the CREATE TABLE

  - show table on left pane

### Stu: 01-animalsDB and 02-FavoriteDB-NoData Part 1

- 710-25 (15 min)

### Ins: Review

- 725-40 (15 min)

- just review 02 unless someone asks about insertions (then go over 01)

- live code

### BREAK

- 740-55 (15 min)

### Ins: Adding and Updating Data In Tables

- 755-810 (15 min)

- There still isn't data in our tables

- We can show this with `SELECT * FROM people;` (bring up table viewer)

- add and run:

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO people (name, has_pet, pet_name, pet_age)
  VALUES ("Spencer", true, "Fluffy", 13);

  SELECT * FROM people;
  ```

- add:

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO people (name, has_pet, pet_name, pet_age)
  VALUES ("Jeff", true, "Sparky", 100);
  ```

- When run with the above a duplicate entry is created. Rows can contain duplicate data (unlike tables and DBs)

- Ask: What will happen when I add the below

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO people (name, has_pet)
  VALUES ("Peter", false);
  ```

- missing columns have `NULL` values

- Since it's sad to not have a pet let's give Peter a pet
- start without the `WHERE`

  ```sql
  UPDATE people
  SET has_pet = true, pet_name = "Baby Yoda"
  WHERE name = "Peter";
  ```

### Stu: 02-FavoriteDB-NoData Part 2

- 810-20 (10 min)

- Take the FavoriteDB from the earlier activity and add data to it

### Ins: 03-animals_dbWithID

- 820-25 (5 min)

- Adds IDs

- Don't open 03-animals_dbWithID yet, start with the below

- Duplicate one person

- We can remove data using:

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM people
  WHERE name = "Spencer";
  ```

- Ask: why did it delete both?

- We need a way to uniquely identify our rows of data. In other words, we need an ID.

- Open `animalsDBWithID.sql`

  - `id` column added

  - `WHERE` selects on ID

  - we set the id as our `PRIMARY KEY`

    - this enforces that id must uniquely identify each row

- We have two Spencer's but can distinguish between IDs

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM people
  WHERE id = 2;
  ```

### Stu: Making and Using an ID Column

- 825-35 (10 min)

- experiment with creating your own table with an ID

### Stu: 04-programmingDB

- 835-50 (15 min)

- Open up `programmingDB` in `04-programmingDB/Solved` and copy the code into MySQL Workbench.

- Go over the bits of code which create "id" and set it as the primary key once more. Make sure everyone understands how this works and explain how useful this will be in this week's homework.

### Ins: Breaking Into the Join

- (10 min)

- Now we are getting into one of the more difficult aspects of MySQL, but tell your class that this information will be very useful to them in the homework should they decide to attempt the challenge assignment.

- Joins allow those using MySQL to combine two or more individual tables together using a value that is shared between them.

- Open up `books.sql` in `05-books` and then copy it into MySQL Workbench. Take a moment to demonstrate the structure of the `books` and `authors` tables.

- Explain that we can utilize joins to combine and display data from both tables. Point out how the `books` table has a foreign key of `authorId` which corresponds to the `id` of a row in the `authors` table. Explain that these tables have what's known as a one-to-many relationship, since a book can only have one author, but an author can have many books.

- Explain that foreign keys are most commonly used to relate tables since primary keys are unique and won't change. Demonstrate each query below, showing students the resulting table, and explaining the differences between each join.

  - INNER JOIN: Combines tables where the specified data-values within a column match one-another

  - LEFT JOIN: Combines tables and shows all of the values of the first table specified while only the values which match on the second side will be shown

  - RIGHT JOIN: Combines tables and shows all of the values of the second table specified while only the values which match on the first table will be shown
