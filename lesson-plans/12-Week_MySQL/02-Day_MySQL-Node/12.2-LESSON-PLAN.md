# 12.2 - Node Gets a SQL

## Overview

While the first class of the week took us away from JavaScript and Node for a tiny bit, today's class combines the old with the new in a way that shows just how powerful a MySQL server can be. With that being said, be on the lookout for small errors in syntax over the course of today's lesson. MySQL is VERY particular about the syntax that is used and this can lead to stress.

## Instructor's Notes

**IMPORTANT**: If you are using MySQL 8, you will need to have your class run the following query in the MySQL Workbench

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'yourRootPassword'
```

Failure to do so will result in

```sh
Error: ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE: Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client
```

Change password with:

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NewPassword';
```

## Learning Objectives

- To create a connection to a MySQL database using Node

- To create, read, update, and delete data from a MySQL database using Node

- To work with a group in taking a basic concept for a server side application and creating a working prototype for that application within a given time frame

### Ins: Welcome Class

- 630-32 (2 min)

### Ins: 06-iceCreamWithConnection

- 632-37 (5 min)

- connects to mysql with Node

- live code

- will have an error, create DB with:

```sql
CREATE database ice_creamDB;
```

### Stu: 06-iceCreamWithConnection

- 637-47 (10 min)

- try connecting to SQL using Node

### Ins: 07-iceCreamReadData

- 647-57 (10 min)

- Base from `06-iceCreamWithConnection`

```js
connection.connect(err => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(`connected as id ${connection.threadId}`);
  selectAll();
});

function selectAll() {
  connection.query('SELECT * FROM products', (err, res) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(res);
    connection.end();
  });
}
```

- Note the ordering and that the query must be within the callback (likely error source)

- the output will say `RowDataPacket` (the classname, we can ignore this)

### Stu: 08-playlistRead

- 657-712 (15 min)

- Practice creating a DB with SQL and then querying in Node

### Ins: Review

- 712-22 (10 min)

- The `?` will be replaced with the contents of the array

### Ins: 09-iceCreamCRUD

- 722-37 (15 min)

```sql
C - CREATE - INSERT INTO pets (name, type, age) VALUES ("fido", "dog", 3);
R - READ   - SELECT * FROM pets;
U - UPDATE - UPDATE pets SET name="under dog" WHERE type = "dog";
D - DELETE - DELETE FROM pets WHERE type = "mouse";
```

- live code the activity

  - keys of object are the columns

- updating data only needs the addition of `WHERE`

- delete is like read except it include a `WHERE` and says `DELETE`

### Stu: 09-iceCreamCRUD

- 737-57 (20 min)

- Add each CRUD operation to your playlist

### BREAK

- 757-812 (15 min)

### Groups Do: Great-Bay

- 812-912 (60 min)

- demo bid system

### Everyone Do: Share Your Work

- 912-30 (18 min)

- see if any groups are willing to share
