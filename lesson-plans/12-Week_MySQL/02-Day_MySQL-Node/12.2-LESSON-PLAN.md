# 12.2 - Node Gets a SQL

## Overview

While the first class of the week took us away from JavaScript and Node for a tiny bit, today's class combines the old with the new in a way that shows just how powerful a MySQL server can be. With that being said, be on the lookout for small errors in syntax over the course of today's lesson. MySQL is VERY particular about the syntax that is used and this can lead to stress.

## Instructor's Notes

**IMPORTANT**: If you are using MySQL 8, you will need to have your class run the following query in the MySQL Workbench

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'yourRootPassword'
```

Failure to do so will result in

```sh
Error: ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE: Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client
```

Change password with:

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NewPassword';
```

## Learning Objectives

- To create a connection to a MySQL database using Node

- To create, read, update, and delete data from a MySQL database using Node

- To work with a group in taking a basic concept for a server side application and creating a working prototype for that application within a given time frame

### Ins: Welcome Class

- 630-32 (2 min)

### Ins: 06-iceCreamWithConnection

- 632-37 (5 min)

- connects to mysql with Node

- live code

- will have an error, create DB with:

```sql
CREATE database ice_creamDB;
```

### Stu: 06-iceCreamWithConnection

- 637-47 (10 min)

- try connecting to SQL using Node

### Ins: 07-iceCreamReadData

- 647-57 (10 min)

- Base from `06-iceCreamWithConnection`

```js
connection.connect(err => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(`connected as id ${connection.threadId}`);
  afterConnection();
});

function afterConnection() {
  connection.query('SELECT * FROM products', (err, res) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(res);
    connection.end();
  });
}
```

- Through calling `connection.query(<STRING>,(err, res) => {})`, we are telling Node to send an SQL query to our database and return the data collected through the "res" variable

- The \<STRING> portion uses SQL syntax and should be contained within a pair of quotes. Because of this, you should tell your students to be very careful with their syntax since even small differences could lead to an error being returned.

  - The query contained within the \<STRING> can be switched out with any other kind of SQL query which will allow you to collect specific types of data as well.

  - Point out that we run the query inside of the body of the `connect` method's callback function. Since the `connection.connect` and `connection.query` methods both run asynchronously, there's no guarantee that the `connection.query` method will run after `connect` if it's run from outside. If we didn't want to put the entire query method inside of the callback, we could also wrap the query method inside of a function. Example:

  ```js
  connection.connect(err => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(`connected with id ${connection.threadId}`);
    selectAll();
  });

  function selectAll() {
    connection.query('SELECT * FROM products', (err, res) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(res);
    });
  }
  ```

  - Inform the class that what's most likely to trip them up while working with the mysql npm package is dealing with asynchrony. One way to deal with this is to kick off the next piece of code from within the callback function of the previous. This will become more clear as we work through the rest of the activities and the homework assignment.

- Run the code in your terminal and the data contained within your database should be returned to you as an array of objects.

  - Be sure to make note of the `RowDataPacket` that comes before each object. Students may think that this would impact the ways in which you would call specific data (eg. `res[0].RowDataPacket.id`), but this is not actually necessary. The data can be called normally.

- Also make sure to note how `res` is only available inside of the scope of the function. `res` would be undefined outside of the query callback function unless the data was stored within a global variable.

### Stu: Collecting Data From a Database

- 657-712 (15 min)

- Once again, more than enough time has been given for this assignment so as to provide students with the opportunity to tackle the bonuses since both of these would assist them greatly in tackling this week's homework.

- While this assignment is going on, take a few moments to take the code contained within `playlistSeeds.sql` in `08-playlistRead` and run it in MySQL Workbench so that you can go over the assignment with the class afterwards

- Check to see if there are any questions from the previous part of the lesson before slacking out the following instructions to the class...

- **Instructions**

  - Using the connection and song data you put together earlier into the class, we are going to print playlists to the Git Bash console based upon the genre or artist.

  - First create code that prints all songs within your database to the terminal.

  - Now create code that prints songs of a specific genre/artist to the terminal.

    - If you don't have many songs in your database at this point in time, take this moment to add some more to it. Try to give yourself a variety of songs to work with.

    - HINT: Remember that you can call specific data using SQL commands we went over last class. If you are having trouble, make sure to look into SQL commands once more.

  - BONUS: Use 'placeholder' values or string concatenation to build a MySQL query which allows you to change pieces of the query on the fly (e.g. using a variable to build the `WHERE` clause, instead of a static string).

    - There are a couple different ways to accomplish this task, but the most common one can be found within the [documentation for the MySQL package](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql#performing-queries).

### Everyone Do: Collecting Data From a Database

- 712-22 (10 min)

- Open up the file titled `playlistRead.js` in `08-playlistRead` in your editor to go over some of the finer points of the past assignment.

  - While the first query is much like that which we went over earlier, the second one is the one that is most interesting because it contains a query that seems incomplete as there is a question mark at the end of it. What this syntax allows the user to do, however, is place an array after the query string whose contents will replace the question marks with those variables contained within the array.

  - Why is this useful? It allows for programmers to plug in multiple variables using the same bit of code. We will go over this kind of thing more in future classes, but anything that makes a piece of code more reusable is a bonus in the wild world of programming.

### Ins: 09-iceCreamCRUD

- 722-37 (15 min)

- When creating programs that deal with databases, there is a rather fun acronym which a lot of programmers use in order to remind themselves which functions they have available to them. This acronym is CRUD :

```
C - CREATE - INSERT INTO pets (name, type, age) VALUES ("fido", "dog", 3);
R - READ   - SELECT * FROM pets;
U - UPDATE - UPDATE pets SET name="under dog" WHERE type = "dog";
D - DELETE - DELETE FROM pets WHERE type = "mouse";
```

- So far we have only really gone over one of the four letters of CRUD today, but now that we have a firm understanding on the basics we can more easily jump into the others without spending as much time on them independently. This is because they all use nearly identical calls to that of your typical READ query with many of the changes only being the SQL query being made.

- Go over each of the following examples one at a time, adding them into your ice-cream application from earlier in the class and running them in your terminal. You may use use `09-iceCreamCRUD` as a guide.

```js
function createProduct() {
  console.log('Inserting a new product...\n');
  const query = connection.query(
    'INSERT INTO products SET ?',
    {
      flavor: 'Rocky Road',
      price: 3.0,
      quantity: 50
    },
    (err, res) => {
      console.log(res.affectedRows + ' product inserted!\n');
      // Call updateProduct AFTER the INSERT completes
      updateProduct();
    }
  );

  // logs the actual query being run
  console.log(query.sql);
}
```

- Point out to students how similar this looks to the code which reads data, with the only major differences being the query made and the data entered.

  - When inserting data into a MySQL database using Node, the format is to use object notation with the keys being the columns that you would like to insert data into.

  - Make sure that the data you are entering into your columns matches the types the server is expecting. Doing otherwise might cause the server to crash since it will not know how to handle the data you are passing it.

- Point out how you can assign the query to a variable and use `query.sql` to determine what the query being run against the database is.

```js
function updateProduct() {
  console.log('Updating all Rocky Road quantities...\n');
  const query = connection.query(
    'UPDATE products SET ? WHERE ?',
    [
      {
        quantity: 100
      },
      {
        flavor: 'Rocky Road'
      }
    ],
    (err, res) => {
      console.log(res.affectedRows + ' products updated!\n');
      // Call deleteProduct AFTER the UPDATE completes
      deleteProduct();
    }
  );

  // logs the actual query being run
  console.log(query.sql);
}
```

- Updating data is VERY similar to creating data, the only significant difference being the addition of the WHERE statement which allows you to interact with specific rows of data

  - Your students will also notice that we are using two question marks within this statement, one for the SET and one for the WHERE. What's cool about this is that, by using an array, we are able to replace both question marks with the elements contained within said array.

  - First question mark is replaced with the first object in the array while the second question mark is replaced with the second object in the array.

```js
function deleteProduct() {
  console.log('Deleting all strawberry icecream...\n');
  connection.query(
    'DELETE FROM products WHERE ?',
    {
      flavor: 'strawberry'
    },
    (err, res) => {
      console.log(res.affectedRows + ' products deleted!\n');
      // Call readProducts AFTER the DELETE completes
      readProducts();
    }
  );
}
```

- Deleting MySQL data through Node is almost entirely identical to a READ query that includes a WHERE statement within it. Not much else to it other than that.

```js
function readProducts() {
  console.log('Selecting all products...\n');
  connection.query('SELECT * FROM products', (err, res) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Log all results of the SELECT statement
    console.log(res);
    connection.end();
  });
}
```

- Students should already be familiar with reading data at this point but ask your class if they have any questions and answer them as best you can before moving onto the next activity.

### Stu: CRUD Playlist

- 737-57 (20 min)

- Slack out the following instructions.

- **Instructions**

  - It's time to start making our playlist application a little more functional through including all four C.R.U.D elements within it.

  - Add in some pieces of code that CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE specific pieces of data from your MySQL database. Make sure to include a READ statement at the end as well to ensure that the changes you are making are working properly.

  - BONUS: After successfully adding CRUD to your application, it's time to test your mettle and see if you can make it so this app is more dynamic. Add the ability for users to dynamically input their own data into the database using the Inquirer NPM package.

    - HINT: Recall that you can create MySQL queries which include variables using question marks. Proper usage of this will help you quite a bit.

    - HINT: Remember to take into account the scope of Inquirer package when putting your application together.

### BREAK

- 757-812 (15 min)

### Groups Do: Great-Bay

- 812-912 (60 min)

- When everyone is back from break, split them up into groups of three or four and then slack out the following instructions...

- **Instructions**

  - Within your groups you are going to be creating a Node application called "Great-Bay" which allows users to create and bid on assorted items, tasks, jobs, or projects.

  - The basic application is fairly simple: Upon loading up the program, the user is prompted on whether they would like to "POST AN ITEM" or "BID ON AN ITEM"

    - If the user selects "POST AN ITEM" they are prompted for an assortment of information regarding the item and then that information is added to the database so that others can bid on it

    - If the user selects "BID ON AN ITEM" they are shown a list of all available items and then are prompted to select what they would like to bid on. The console then asks them how much they would like to bid, and their bid is compared to the previous highest bid. If their bid is higher, inform the user of their success and replace the previous bid with the new one. If their bid is lower (or equal), inform the user of their failure and boot them back to the selection screen.

  - Once your group has put together the basic application, it's time to test your collective skills on some additional functionality, or "addons". Remember to take into consideration the amount of time you have been given when choosing what addons you would like to tackle.

    - Create a sign up and login system that prompts users for a username and password upon loading up the app. **Do not worry about setting up a truly secure database if you choose to tackle this addon. Just worry about building working sign up and login features.**

    - Create a system on the "POST AN ITEM" which allows users to look at the auctions they have created. On this screen they can add new auctions, modify previous auctions, or close bidding on an auction.

    - Create a system which allows users to view all of the auctions of which they are the leading bidder.

    - Create a third option on the main screen which allows administrators to modify the database as they see fit.

    - Create visually appealing tables. This means making dynamic console code and it is a lot harder than it might seem at first so do not think this one is so simple.

    - Create a search function that allows users to look through the database of available auctions to find those that share the specified keyword or username.

    - Get creative! There are a lot of addons to this app which you could create so feel free to work with your group to come up with something not listed above!

### Everyone Do: Share Your Work

- 912-32 (20 min)

- With any luck, the class has been able to tackle not only the basic assignment, but has also managed to put together a few different addons for the application which they can share with everyone else.

- Start out this part of the class by asking a group who feels confident in their code for the basic application and is confident that it works to slack it out and then walk the rest of the class through it. Make yourself available to answer questions the rest of the class might have regarding the group's code if there are any individuals who seem very confused.

- Next, start running through the list of addons we suggested above and see if there are any groups out there who are willing to share their solutions with the class.

- Finally, ask the class if there were any groups who went above and beyond to create their own addons for the application and have them share this code with the class as well.
