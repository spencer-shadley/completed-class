# 11.2 - Express Yourself

## Overview

- Routing, request/response handling and GET/POST requests

- Guided Star Wars application - https://star-wars-sshadley.herokuapp.com/

- Next Class: [hot-restaurant.herokuapp.com](http://hot-restaurant.herokuapp.com)

- Everything builds up to the HW - http://friend-finder.herokuapp.com

### Slides

- 630-40 (10 min)

### Ins: 08-StarWars-1

- 640-45 (5 min)

- demo Star Wars - https://star-wars-sshadley.herokuapp.com/

  - https://star-wars-sshadley.herokuapp.com/api/characters/yoda

- Demo `server1.js`

- start the app with `npm run start`

- demo watch with `npm run watch`

  - `npm install -g nodemon`

### Stu: 08-StarWars-1

- 645-55 (10 min)

- add another route to this code

### Ins: Review

- 655-7 (5 min)

- live code, adding the below

```js
const obiwankenobi = {
  name: 'Obi Wan Kenobi',
  role: 'Jedi Knight',
  age: 42,
  forcePoints: 13400
};

app.get('/obiwankenobi', (req, res) => res.json(obiwankenobi));
```

### Partners: 09-StarWars-2

- 7-05 (5 min)

- investigate req.params

### Ins: Review

- The `/:character` is a "variable" parameter in the URL route

- demo

### Partners: 10-StarWars-3

- 705-10 (5 min)

- examine the updated code with a partner

### Ins: Review

- 710-25 (15 min)

- solution is 11-StarWars-4 (just adds comments)

### Ins: 12-StarWars-5

- 725-30 (5 min)

- POST

### Stu: 13-StarWars-6

- 730-40 (10 min)

- adds middleware

### Ins: Review

- 740-45 (5 min)

- discuss middleware

  - middleware are functions which are run between the server receiving a request and it being available in our routes
  - express allows adding middleware with `app.use`
  - we are using middleware here to transform the request from the browser before we work with it
  - Normally data sent to the server isn't easily readable by humans, as it comes in as a low level stream.
  - we need `express.urlencoded` and `express.json` take an unreadable request and convert it to a readable object attached to `req` as `req.body`

    - the requests are sending data and are asking the server to accept and store the data in the body `req.body`
    - `express.json` recognizes incoming request objects as JSON objects
      - only parses JSON based on the `Content-Type` header, accepts JSON or gzip'd JSON
      - populates `req.body` on the request
    - `express.urlencoded` treat incoming request object as strings or arrays
      - parses URL encoded requests (part of the params)
      - often happens on forms as `x-www-form-urlencoded`
      - populates a `req.body` on the request
      - If the headers mismatch or are missing the extended option states whether it will container key-value pairs or accepts any type when extended is true

- demo Postman

- If we go to http://localhost:3000/api/characters in a browser it just lists the characters

  - why isn't using our new route?

  - Use POSTMAN to demo adding a new character

  ```js
  {
    "routeName": "anakin",
    "name": "Anakin Skywalker",
    "role": "Jedi",
    "age": 22,
    "midichlorianCount": 27700
  }
  ```

  - make sure to select "raw" in the body and then "text" > "JSON"

  - then do a character search for anakin and it finds it

### Stu: 13-StarWars-6 (Postman)

- 745-55 (10 min)

- Now have students perform the same exercise with their own servers

### Break

- 755-810 (15 min)

### Ins: 13-StarWars-6 (sendFile)

- 810-15 (5 min)

- explain `sendFile`

- discuss path to return html file

  - would have worked as a relative path but is safer to do an absolute path in case express is ever started from a different directory

  - `__dirname` is built into node just like `process`

### Stu: 13-StarWars-6 (view.html)

- 815-25 (10 min)

- inspect the given `view.html` file to see how we are interacting with the server

### Ins: Review Activity

- 825-30 (5 min)

### Ins: Demo Complete Application

- 830-35 (5 min)

- Open the completed application found in `14-FinalStarWarsApp`. Walk students through the overall directory structure and how there is a mix of the `server.js` file and the HTML files which will be relayed to users. Also point out how we have a new `add.html` file.

### Stu: 14-FinalStarwarsApp (add.html)

- 835-45 (10 min)

- in groups students will dissect the final version, specifically `add.html`

### Ins: Review 14-FinalStarwarsApp (add.html)

- 845-50 (5 min)

### Ins: Introduce Heroku

- 850-55 (5 min)

- Ask: How have we been deploying?

- Ask: Why won't GitHub Pages work anymore?

  - it's only static front-end - it doesn't support the server side of our app
  - really, it's just hosting static assets on a publicly accessible machine

- Ask: What options do we have for hosting our app?

  - Heroku

  - Heroku is PaaS, it handles deployment of back-end, host static assets and run server-side code for us

### Stu: Deploy to Heroku

- 855-925 (30 min)

- Time to host the Star Wars app on Heroku!
