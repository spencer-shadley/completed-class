## Slides

### Ins: Quick Recap "Server" Concepts

- 630-35 (5 min)

### Everyone: Introduce Express

- 635-40 (5 min)

- Use the slides to introduce the concept of the Express framework and routing.

- At one point in the slideshow you will be pointed to the NYT Scraper App website. Remind students how the webpage works (namely that the site lets users retrieve articles from the New York Times and store them in a "saved" list). Then use the proceeding slides to discuss the concept of GET and POST routes. Give them a heads-up that we'll be able to use AJAX and jQuery to make both these types of communications.

### Ins: Demo basic routing with server1.js

- 640-45 (5 min)

- Before you start working with the code go to the link: [starwars-express-fsf.herokuapp.com/](https://starwars-express-fsf.herokuapp.com/) and show students how the page works. Essentially, you can type in a Star Wars Character's name and search the "database" to see his/her properties. You can also add characters to the database using the simple form. Add a character and show how it gets displayed on both the page and the API. (Note: When searching do not enter spaces between character names).

  - To show the API you can simply go to this link: <http://starwars-express-fsf.herokuapp.com/api>. The api also accepts an additional parameter at the end of the URL in the form of <http://starwars-express-fsf.herokuapp.com/api/charactername>. As an example: <http://starwars-express-fsf.herokuapp.com/api/yoda>.

- Now open the file `server1.js` (`08-StarWars-1`). Walk students through the general gist of the code. _For now the key focus is to give them an understanding of express(), routing, and the listener_.

- Run the `server1.js` file and show them how it works. (Don't forget to talk about `npm install`).

- Once you've discussed the key pieces proceed to the first activity.

### Stu: Add Route to server1.js

- 645-55 (10 min)

- Slack out the following file and instructions:

- **File:**

  - `server1.js` (`08-StarWars-1`)

- **Instructions:**

  - Work with those around you to confirm your `server1.js` file working. This means figuring out: what dependencies to install, how to run the file, and how to view the resulting website in your browser. This step requires you to make ZERO changes to the code file. At this point, you are just getting the file you are given to run.

  - Then, once you've gotten the original code to display in the browser, create a new `Obi Wan Kenobi route` to display Kenobi's information. Use the comments and the previous code in the file as a guide.

  - Help those around you when done.

### Ins: Review Previous Activity

- 655-7 (5 min)

- Review the previous activity by coding it out yourself. Your solution should look like something of the below:

```js
const obiwankenobi = {
  name: 'Obi Wan Kenobi',
  role: 'Jedi Knight',
  age: 42,
  forcePoints: 1350
};

app.get('/obiwankenobi', function(req, res) {
  res.json(obiwankenobi);
});
```

### Partners: Dissect req.params

- 7-05 (5 min)

### Ins: Review

- Have students try to explain to you what they found.

- If no one offers the correct answer, explain that the `/:character` syntax is a way of saying we have a "variable" parameter in the URL route. Show them via the browser that this means they can search for a given character using the URL and it will display in the console.

### Partners: Dissect Parameter Match

- 705-10 (5 min)

### Ins: Review Previous Activity

- 710-15 (5 min)

- Use the same process as before to ask students to explain the for-loop concept to you.

- If no one offers the correct answer, explain that this for-loop "checks" which character is being sought after in the URL -- then finds that character's information and re-displays it back to the user in the form of a JSON.

  - Show them how this works by searching for the character `yoda`. Then try searching for a non-existent character like `hansolo`.

- Ask students of an example where this concept of routing where the URL is changing might be found. (suggested answer: Newspapers. Every newspaper has a url like `/2016/01/01/Great-story-of-the-day` )

### Ins: Re-demonstrate Previous Solved Activity

- 715-25 (10 min)

- If needed, open the file `server4.js` (`11-StarWars-4`). This file simply includes a line-by-line commenting of the previous example. Slack out this file to students so they can look over it during the next few exercises.

### Ins: Show code for Post Route

- 725-30 (5 min)

- Now open the file `server5.js` (`12-StarWars-5`). In this example, simply point students through the fact that we've created a new POST route. Explain that this route will take in JSON inputs then DO work with them. In this case it will save the JSON to the database and return a JSON of the new character.

### Stu: req.body dissection

- 730-40 (10 min)

### Ins: Postman Demo

- 740-45 (5 min)

- Have students articulate their answers before explaining to them that `express.json` and `express.urlEncoded` are modules built-in to express that allow Express to receive user posts (JSON, text, etc).

- Normally and data sent to the server isn't easily readable by humans, as it comes in as a low level stream.

- Explain that `express.json` and `express.urlEncoded` are examples of **middleware**.

  - Middleware is a function which we set to run between our server receiving a request and it being available inside of our routes.

  - Middleware can be defined using the `app.use` method.

  - Middleware can transform the request from the browser before we work with it. In the case of `express.json` and `express.urlEncoded`, it takes the unreadable request and turns it into a readable object and attaches it to `req.body`. By the time the request gets to our routes, our body parsing middleware has already formatted it for us.

- Then explain to them that in future applications we'll eventually be using jQuery's AJAX methods for sending such post requests to our server.

- Then have them install the program [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). We'll be using Postman so both windows users and mac users can be taught how to send POST requests using the same program. (Note: Students may ask questions like: "Do you always have to use postman to send post requests?" Use this as an opportunity to explain that Postman is simply a GUI for development, and that in future opportunities we'll be using jQuery or other front-end code approaches for sending the same post requests.)

- Walk students through the process of sending POST requests in Postman. If you are unfamiliar use the following points as a guide:

  1. Run your server instance.
  2. Open Postman.
  3. Select POST in the drop-down next to the link. Then enter the URL of your server's POST route.
  4. Click the button: "Body". Click the setting "Raw". Then hit the dropdown that says "Text" and click JSON.
  5. Enter in a complete JSON. You can use:
     ```json
     {
       "routeName": "darthvader",
       "name": "Darth Vader",
       "role": "Sith Lord",
       "age": 42,
       "forcePoints": 1900
     }
     ```
  6. Hit "Send"
  7. Now check back to your Star Wars API to confirm that Postman received the request body.
     ### 15. Students Do: Postman Exercise

- 745-55 (10 min)

- Now have students perform the same exercise with their own servers

### 16. Break

- 755-810 (15 min)

### Ins: Demo sendFile (server6.js + view.html)

- 810-15 (5 min)

- Open the file `server6.js` (`13-StarWars-6`). Look at the line under the `app.get('/')` route. Point out to students the use of the `res.sendFile` code. This code is used to send users a specific HTML file in response to their visiting a route.

  - Be sure to point out how we make use of the built in `path` library to join relative and absolute file paths. In this case, we **could** just omit `path.join` pass `sendFile` relatives paths to the HTML files instead, but it's safer to provide absolute paths in case our Express app is ever started from a different directory. Normally this would be an issue, since absolute paths will almost always be different on different computers, as well as on Heroku. Thankfully we can make use of Node's built in `path` library. `path.join` is a function which accepts any number of String arguments, which are also expected to be file paths or partial file paths. `path.join` takes the passed in file paths, combines them into a new path, and returns it.

- The `__dirname` keyword is built into Node and available in every JavaScript file on the server. It's always equal to a the absolute path of the current directory. By passing `__dirname` as well as the relative path to the file we want to send into `path.join`, we'll get back an absolute path to the specified file.

### Stu: Dissect .get view.html

- 815-25 (10 min)

### Ins: Review Activity

- 825-30 (5 min)

- Review the previous exercise and answer any questions. Try to get students to think about the distinction between routing users to "data" and routing them to rendered "HTML" pages. Try to get them to think about when you would use `res.json` and when you would use `res.sendFile`.

### Ins: Demo Complete Application

- 830-35 (5 min)

- Open the completed application found in `14-FinalStarWarsApp`. Walk students through the overall folder structure and how there is a mix of the `server.js` file and the HTML files which will be relayed to users. Also point out how we have a new `add.html` file.

### Stu: Dissect .post (add.html)

- 835-45 (10 min)

### Ins: Review Activity (add.html)

- 845-50 (5 min)

- Walk students through the meaning of the JavaScript in `add.html`. Go line by line and explain how jQuery is used to grab the values in the form -- then immediately POSTs these values to the API. The API then saves the records into the database.

- Finally, slack out a link to the [YouTube video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/ygk-kNstqK0?list=PLgJ8UgkiorCmI_wKKVt5FlkTG63sQF6rr) and encourage them to review at home. This will be a _huge_ help to students.

### Ins: Introduce Heroku

- 850-55 (5 min)

- Local development is fun, but it's much more fun to deploy and share with others!

- Ask students what we've been using so far to deploy, and ask if anyone has any idea why that solution might not work now.

  - After students give suggestions, explain that GitHub Pages only hosts "static" pages, and doesn't support the server side of our application.
  - Explain that GitHub Pages won't actually run any code for your app, it just hosts your HTML, CSS, JS, and other static files. It's similar to accessing your local files through your browser, only they're on a publicly accessible machine.

- That means we need something that will both host our files _and_ run our server-side code.

- Ask them if they can guess what we're going to use to host our full-stack application.

  - There are a ton of options, but specifically we're going to be using Heroku!

- Explain that Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS). It allows deployment of a back-end and will start up and host your web server and server-side code for you!
  - Explain that the value here is similar to that of GitHub Pages, but for your whole app.
  - Heroku will manage your application and give it a public URL that anyone can access.

### Stu: Deploy to Heroku

- 855-925 (30 min)

- Tell students that to wrap up today we're going to host that Star Wars app, so that even those in a galaxy far, far away can access it.

- Then have students login to their Heroku accounts online. Many of them will have forgotten their passwords, and may spend a significant portion of this activity getting set up.

### Troubleshooting Guide

- **Forgetting to git "add -A, git commit -m":** Often students will completely skip the step where they save and commit their changes prior to pushing to GitHub. This will mean their web page is essentially blank. As a starting point, ensure their code is present in GitHub before tinkering with Heroku issues. If they have no code in GitHub, they certainly have no code in Heroku

- **Images and/or CSS not appearing:** All filenames and paths are case sensitive. Ensure that all links in HTML are using case-sensitive paths that match the folder directories casing.

- **Not using relative paths:** Students using absolute paths to reference their CSS, JS, or image files. Help them to convert these to relative paths.

- **Not knowing where their site deployed:** Show students that they need to login to the site and they will see the new app deployed on their menu. Then help them go to Settings and scroll until you see the "Heroku Domain".

- **Heroku Login not working on Windows:** For first time Windows Users, you need to use `cmd.exe` to login to Heroku. If you do not do this, bash will likely prevent you from logging in and you will be unable to proceed with Heroku Steps.

- **More than five Heroku apps:** As students progress in the course, they will have many more Heroku apps. Once you get to five apps, Heroku requires users to authenticate their identity with a credit card. This credit card won't be charged, but its a requirement to have more than five active apps.

- **Not using environment variable for port:** Help students update their app so that they are getting the port the app is listening on from `process.env.PORT`.

- **Not having start script in `package.json`:** Help students update their app so that they have a start script in the `scripts` block of their `package.json` file, and ensure that they can run `npm start` to start up their server.

- **Not having production dependencies in `package.json`:** Ensure that any required packages are listed in the `dependencies` block in the `package.json` file.
