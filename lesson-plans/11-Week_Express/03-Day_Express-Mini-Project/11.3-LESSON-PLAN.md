# 11.3 - Express Mini-Project

### Ins: Welcome

- 10-05 (5 min)

### Ins: Demo End Application

- 1005-20 (15 min)

- Demo the app on http://localhost:8080/

### Ins: Group Formation + Initial Instructions

- 1020-30 (10 min)

- Have students divide themselves into groups of 4

- Let them know that you will be providing them with guidance on how to proceed every 20 minutes or so.

### Partners Do: Phase I - Pseudocode

- 1030-45 (15 min)

- For this first phase, slack out the following instructions:

- **Instructors/TAs:** Once time is up have students share their breakdowns. As a suggestion, here is a list that you can slack them.

  - Create the front-end (visuals) for home page, reservation form, and reservation views.

  - Create a basic server using Express.JS

  - Create a few array variables that will hold the data

  - Create a set of routes for getting and posting table data

  - Create a set of routes for displaying the HTML pages

  - Use jQuery to run AJAX calls to GET and POST data from users to the Express server

### Partners Do: Phase II - Frontend + Server Creation (Critical)

- 1045-1105 (20 min)

- **Instructors/TAs:**

  - Have students who accomplished this task share their code with you (via GitHub) and display it on screen. Then have them come up and talk about what they did.

### Partners Do: Phase III - API Routing + Frontend Delivery (Critical)

- 1105-45 (40 min)

### Break

- 1145-1220 (35 min)

### Partners Do: Phase IV - Backend Logic + AJAX (High)

- 1220-120 (60 min)

### Partners Do: Phase V - Debugging + Bonus

- 120-40 (20 min)

### Ins: Recap

- 140-45 (5 min)

- Take the stage again. Let students know that this was a hard activity but an incredibly realistic one.

- Encourage them by informing them that they've reached a highly significant point in their coding careers. Being able to build front-end and back-end applications like this one will allow them to build any number of applications.

- Slack out the [video solution](https://youtu.be/G7RvQMW2DOg?list=PLgJ8UgkiorCmI_wKKVt5FlkTG63sQF6rr) and HIGHLY HIGHLY encourage them to review it on their own. Let them know that the accompanying code has been thoroughly commented and that they should consider working in groups to dissect it.

### Ins: Review

- 145-2 (15 min)

- Ask the class if they would prefer to just keep working since there is a video solution

### MySQL Install

- We will be coming up on MySQL next class. Let student's know to install MySQL Server and Workbench. Guides have been provided so slack these out to students:

  - [MySQL Install Mac](../../12-Week/01-Day/Install_Guides/mysql-mac-guide.md)
  - [MySQL Install Windows](../../12-Week/01-Day/Install_Guides/mysql-windows-guide.md)

- If your class runs into trouble with this install process, feel free to use MAMP or any other installation solution that you would prefer to get the class ready.
