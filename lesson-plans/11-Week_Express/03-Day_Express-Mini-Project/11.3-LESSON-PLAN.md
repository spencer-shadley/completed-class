# 11.3 - Express Mini-Project (10:00 AM)

## Overview

Today, we'll be asking students to create an Express based web application for handling reservation requests. In the process of building today's assignment, students will reinforce their understanding of Express Servers, Routing, and the utility AJAX for front-end interaction.

## Instructor Priorities

- Students should be given the entire class to create today's activity.
- Instructor/TAs should focus on providing students assistance in small-group format.

- Welcome back! Today's class will be one of the more challenging ones for students, as we will be pushing them to use their rudimentary skills with Node/Express to create a real-world application. The focus for the day is to immerse them in a build-it-first approach to learning.

- Stronger students will find today's class refreshing because of the challenge, but weaker students may walk out fairly confused.

- The emphasis for today's class is to let students drive and to assist them in _small groups_. Don't try to overly "walk" the entire class through the app via lecture today. Take the podium when necessary, share code when appropriate, but try to spend more of your time working with individual groups. What you will quickly find is that groups are in dramatically different places and often working through very specific issues.

- Towards the end of class, let all students know that there is a thorough video outlining the solution to this activity that you will Slack out. (See Recap + Closing Thoughts)

- Throughout today's class, constantly encourage students to look back at the previous activity from class on the Star Wars Express application.

- Additionally, you may want to slack students a copy of the diagram below as a reference at some point during their coding. It may help them visualize the overall application they are building.

## Learning Objectives

- To create a real-world application for handling reservations using Node/Express

### Ins: Welcome

- 10-05 (5 min)

- Then when everyone gets settled give students a few moments to ask high-level questions regarding the previous class.

- Let students know that the concepts covered this week regarding Node and Express servers are some of the most important concepts in the class. Let them know that it really gets to the heart of what full-stack web development is -- and for this reason, it's important they push themselves to learn it now.

- Slack out the below resources:

  - <https://scotch.io/tutorials/use-expressjs-to-get-url-and-post-parameters>

  - <https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4>

### Ins: Demo End Application

- 1005-20 (15 min)

- Then begin to remind students that the best way to learn to code -- especially challenging concepts -- is sometimes just to force yourself to code. For this reason, today's class will be a 4-hour session in which you'll be building a real-world application that makes use of the concepts we're covering so far.

- Slack out the following link: [hot-restaurant.herokuapp.com](http://hot-restaurant.herokuapp.com).

  - Then ask all students to make a Reservation request on the website.

- Once they are done, visit the page: <http://hot-restaurant.herokuapp.com/tables>. Point out how their reservation requests have been captured and listed on the site. Depending on whether or not they were one of the first five requests, they were added to the reservation list -- otherwise they were put on the waitlist.

  - Then take a few moments to flip through the screens. Point out how there is a page for creating reservations, a page for viewing reservations, and two pages for viewing JSONs of the current reservations and waitlisted parties.

    - Let students know that they will be building this application from scratch over the course of the next few hours.

- Feel free to open up the `phases.md` file found in `15-HotRestaurant` folder and keep it on the screen during the development. Scroll down to the next phase when the time is up.

### Ins: Group Formation + Initial Instructions

- 1020-30 (10 min)

- Have students divide themselves into groups of 4 (with 2 members from each section).

- Let them know that you will be providing them with guidance on how to proceed every 20 minutes or so.

### Partners Do: Phase I - Pseudocode

- 1030-45 (15 min)

- For this first phase, slack out the following instructions:

- **Instructors/TAs:** Once time is up have students share their breakdowns. As a suggestion, here is a list that you can slack them.

  - Create the front-end (visuals) for home page, reservation form, and reservation views.

  - Create a basic server using Express.JS

  - Create a few array variables that will hold the data

  - Create a set of routes for getting and posting table data

  - Create a set of routes for displaying the HTML pages

  - Use jQuery to run AJAX calls to GET and POST data from users to the Express server

### Partners Do: Phase II - Frontend + Server Creation (Critical)

- 1045-1105 (20 min)

- **Instructors/TAs:**

  - Have students who accomplished this task share their code with you (via GitHub) and display it on screen. Then have them come up and talk about what they did.

### Partners Do: Phase III - API Routing + Frontend Delivery (Critical)

- 1105-45 (40 min)

### Break

- 1145-1220 (35 min)

### Partners Do: Phase IV - Backend Logic + AJAX (High)

- 1220-120 (60 min)

### Partners Do: Phase V - De-bugging + Bonus

- 120-40 (20 min)

### Ins: Recap

- 140-45 (5 min)

- Take the stage again. Let students know that this was a hard activity but an incredibly realistic one.

- Encourage them by informing them that they've reached a highly significant point in their coding careers. Being able to build front-end and back-end applications like this one will allow them to build any number of applications.

- Slack out the [video solution](https://youtu.be/G7RvQMW2DOg?list=PLgJ8UgkiorCmI_wKKVt5FlkTG63sQF6rr) and HIGHLY HIGHLY encourage them to review it on their own. Let them know that the accompanying code has been thoroughly commented and that they should consider working in groups to dissect it.

### Ins: Review

- 145-2 (15 min)

- Ask the class if they would prefer to just keep working since there is a video solution

### MySQL Install

- We will be coming up on MySQL next class. Let student's know to install MySQL Server and Workbench. Guides have been provided so slack these out to students:

  - [MySQL Install Mac](../../12-Week/01-Day/Install_Guides/mysql-mac-guide.md)
  - [MySQL Install Windows](../../12-Week/01-Day/Install_Guides/mysql-windows-guide.md)

- If your class runs into trouble with this install process, feel free to use MAMP or any other installation solution that you would prefer to get the class ready.
