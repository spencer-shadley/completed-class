# 13.2 Lesson Plan: Bringing it from the Front to the Back

## Overview

Slack out this link before class - https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/whatisrest.html#

Express + Handlebars + MySQL to create a full-stack application (front-end, back-end and DB) supporting all CRUD operations

### Ins: Welcome Students and Demo the Warm Up

- 630-35 (5 min)

- Welcome your students to class

### Stu: Handlebars Animals

- 635-55 (20 min)

- `npm install`

- `npm run watch`

- demo

  - http://localhost:3000/dog
  - http://localhost:3000/all-pets
  - http://localhost:3000/all-non-pets

### Ins: Review

- 655-710 (15 min)

- live code

### Ins: In Need of Some REST

- 710-20 (10 min)

- REST (Representational State Transfer) is a style of architecture which sets constraints for creating web services
- Web services conforming to REST are called RESTful
- It defines standards on how to interact with a web service
- Six constraints

  - _Uniform Interface_
    - URIs to identify
    - server sends standard representations of the db
    - sufficient information to process such as encoding or MIME type
  - _stateless_
    - the necessary state to handle the request is contained within the request such as in the URI, parameters or body
  - _cacheable_
    - clients can cache responses and responses must define themselves as cacheable
  - _separate the server and client_
    - separation of concerns - clients don't care about data storage and servers don't care about user interface
  - _layered system_
    - intermediary connections are allowed. A client cannot tell if it is connected to an end server or something between it such as load-balancer
  - _code on demand (optional)_
    - Servers can customize the client code by transferring logic to it that it can execute such as JavaScript or Java applets

- HTTP is a tool used to comply with this architecture, it enables building RESTful architecture

  - in itself it is not RESTful, it is a protocol for sending data which, when the six conditions above are met, can be used to create a RESTful application

- Today we will build a RESTful service using HTTP

- Describe GET, POST, PUT and DELETE

### Ins: 07-TaskSaver

- 720-35 (15 min)

- server which reads data from a DB and allows POSTing new data to it

- run `schema.sql`

- demo the app

- start with `server.js`

- `main.handlebars`

- `index.handlebars`

- show the network request in Chrome (explain 3XX means success with no content returned)

- `express.json` and `express.urlEncoded` are used for `req.body.task`

- the `textarea` sets up a key (`name="task"`) for the POST data

### Stu: 08-Wishes

- 735-55 (20 min)

- demo app, then let them build it

### BREAK

- 745-8 (15 min)

### Ins: Revew

- 830-45 (10 min)

- debug

  - Settings > search "Node debug" > turn on auto-attach
  - `node --insepct server`
  - `npm run debug`

### Ins: 09-DayPlanner

- 840-9 (20 min)

- adds PUT/DELETE

- jquery ajax calls to interact

### Stu: 10-WatchList

- 9-20 (20 min)

### Review

- 920-28 (8 min)

### Closing

- 928-30 (2 min)

- reminder that Catherine will be teaching on Saturday

- Saturday we will be discussing Object Relational Mapping (ORM) and MVC to make writing to our databases more powerful
