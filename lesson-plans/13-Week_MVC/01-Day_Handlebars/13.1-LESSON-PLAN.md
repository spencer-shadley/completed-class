# 13.1 Lesson Plan: I Can Make an App with Some Handlebars

## Overview

Students will be diving into the basics of Handlebars today, a semantic templating language which can be used to link back-end javascript data to front-end HTML with relative ease.

- Before jumping into Handlebars, we will be going over how to send MySQL data from the back-end to the front-end. Depending upon how well this goes, you may or may not wish to review Express some more today and tackle Handlebars later in the week.

- Handlebars can seem daunting at first, but it is ultimately a very powerful templating tool which your students might find useful. Try to keep to a pace that your students seem comfortable learning, so as to make sure no one is left behind.

## Learning Objectives

- To send MySQL data from the back-end to the front-end using Express

- To understand semantic templating using Handlebars

- To understand the basic syntax for Handlebars-based web applications

- To create an Express connection to a front-end application which prints data to the screen using Handlebars

### Ins: Welcome Students

- 630-35 (5 min)

### Stu: 01-ExpressCalculator

- 635-55 (20 min)

- Express app which supports routes for add, subtract, etc.

### Ins: Review

- 655-705 (10 min)

- live code

### Ins: 02-MagicalSchools

- 705-20 (15 min)

- Creates data in a database and then uses that data to generate HTML

- Run `schema.sql` in Workbench

- Run `magicSchools.js`

### Partners: 03-SeinfeldApp

- 720-40 (20 min)

- similar to harry potter, node app which reads db data and generates HTML

- demo the app (run `schema.sql` then the node app)

  - <http://localhost:3000/cast>
  - <http://localhost:3000/coolness-chart>
  - <http://localhost:3000/attitude-chart/relaxed>

### Ins: Review

- 740-55 (15 min)

- if time is available, live code for 15 minutes

- if time is not available, this can be 10 minutes

### Ins: SQL + HTML = Bad Idea

- 755-8 (5 min)

- Ask: What are some problems with this method of generating HTML? Why might we want to avoid this?

  - We have to write a lot of HTML inside JavaScript

  - we are mixing the view and core business logic

- thank you to Catherine

### BREAK

- 8-15 (15 min)

### Ins: 04-handlebars/harry-potter

- 815-45 (30 min)

- live code this

- What is a template engine

  - use static template files in application
  - the template engine replaces variables in the template file with actual values, transforming the template to actual HTML
  - draw on whiteboard some rectangles with squiggles (HTML) and holes (missing data) with arrows to complete HTML (template + data = HTML)
    - the template engine is what does this conversion process
  - template engines replace our unruly HTML strings in JavaScript code to make our code more flexible

  - default Express template engine is Pug (renamed from Jade)

- `handlebars` is an extension of `mustache`

- Write the code!

- core of `server.js`

```js
'use strict';

const express = require('express');
const expressHandlebars = require('express-handlebars');

const app = express();

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// set our template engine to 'handlebars'
// and set our primary HTML layout to 'main' (which the views will build on)
app.engine('handlebars', expressHandlebars({ defaultLayout: 'main' }));

// use handlebars for our view engine
app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');

app.get('*', (req, res) =>
  res.render('index', { hello: 'world', url: req.url })
);

app.listen(PORT, () =>
  console.log(`Server listening on: http://localhost:${PORT}`)
);
```

- Handlebars requires a very specific directory structure...

- Our templates are under `views` (create `views/index.handlebars`)

- `expression`s go inside `{{}}` (kind of like template literals)

```js
<h1>
  {{ hello }} from {{ url }}
</h1>
```

- and layouts go under `views/layouts` (create `views/layouts/main.handlebars`)

- `layout` allows injecting into it with `{{{ stuff }}}` (triple allows rendering as directly inserted text, double escapes HTML)

  - `body` is the reserved `hook` handlebars will look for when injecting our views

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Schools</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {{{ body }}}
  </body>
</html>
```

- we now have a working server!

  - demo a few URLs

- add another template for schools

  - `server.js`

  ```js
  app.get('/schools', (req, res) =>
    res.render('schools', {
      schools: ['Ilvermorny', 'Hogwarts', 'Durmstrang Institute']
    })
  );
  ```

  - `views/schools.handlebars`

  - blocks

    - `#X` starts a block and `/X` ends it (like HTML tags)

    - `this` is a reference the current context, the thing that was passed in

    ```html
    <h1>Magical Schools</h1>
    <ul>
      {{#each schools }}
      <li>{{this}}</li>
      {{/each}}
    </ul>
    ```

- let's read from our database like earlier

  - `server.js`

  database setup:

  ```js
  const mysql = require('mysql'); // npm install mysql --save

  const connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 3306,
    user: 'root',
    password: 'password',
    database: 'wizard_schools_db'
  });

  connection.connect(err => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('error connecting', err.stack);
      return;
    }
    app.listen(PORT, () =>
      console.log(`Server listening on: http://localhost:${PORT}`)
    );
    console.log(`connected with id ${connection.threadId}`);
  });
  ```

  - updated schools route:

  ```js
  app.get('/schools', (req, res) => {
    connection.query('SELECT * FROM schools', (err, schools) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      res.render('schools', { schools: schools });
    });
  });
  ```

  - add a path expression to handlebars

  ```html
  <h1>Magical Schools</h1>
  <ul>
    {{#each schools }}
    <li>{{this.name}}</li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
  ```

- we still need to update `schools.handlebars` to parse the given data (`this.name`)

- this logic, however, probably belongs in our server code

  - `server.js`

  ```js
  const schoolNames = schools.map(school => school.name);
  res.render('schools', { schools: schoolNames });
  ```

### Partners: 04-handlebars/lunch

- 845-55 (10 min)

- in pairs look through the lunch code together

### Ins: Review

- 855-905 (10 min)

- This is similar to Harry Potter, go over the code

### Partners: 05-BenAndJerrys

- 905-20 (15 min)

- Create your own handlebars express app

- Use the previous examples (`04-handlebars`) as references

- this activity should end at 9:20, extend if there is time

### Ins: Review

- 920-30 (10 min)

### Ins: Closing Thoughts

- We're now able to begin re-using HTML code

- We can also better use "separation of concerns"

  - V: the view (handlebars template) should be a dumb thing that can render data

  - M: later, a model will represent and store that data

  - C: and a controller will put them together

- On Thursday we will combine Express, Handlebars and MySQL to make full-stack applications supporting all CRUD operations

- On Saturday we will be discussing Object Relational Mapping (ORM) and MVC to make writing to our databases more powerful

- heads-up, on Saturday I will be out and Catherine will be subbing

### Handlebars Notes

- about `handlebars`

  - context using block helpers `#with` or `#each` which support `../` to go to parent's context

    ```js
    {{#each people}}
    {{../prefix}} {{firstname}}
    {{/each}}
    ```

- custom helpers

  ```js
  Handlebars.registerHelper('loud', function(aString) {
    return aString.toUpperCase();
  });

  {{firstname}} {{loud lastname}}
  ```

  - `this` context is received as the context

  ```js
  {{#if condition}}
  condition is met
  {{ else }}
  {{/if}}
  ```

```js
{{#each anyArray}}
  {{this}}
{{/each}}
```

- Partials

  - Shared templates

  ```js
  Handlebars.registerPartial(
    'person',
    '{{person.name}} is {{person.age}} years old.\n'
  );

  {{#each persons}}
  {{>person person=.}}
  {{/each}}
  ```

  - dynamic partials

    - evaluate the expression and then render the partial whose name is returned by this function

    ```js
    {{> (whichPartial) }}
    ```
