# 24.2 - Project Work

# Announcements

- I have some announcements

- then I will take Q&A

- then we will go over preclass drills

- the rest of class is time to work on the final project, you should be focusing on presentations today

  - when preparing your project keep in mind:

    - structure
    - key messages
    - keep in mind you only have 10 minutes - choose your content selectively

    1. What problem does your app focus on.
    2. How does your app solve this problem at a high-level.
    3. What steps did you take to build the app.
    4. Show the app running and solving the problem that began your story.
    5. What features you'd like to add in an update to your app.

# Post bootcamp resources and advice

- thank you notes

- show `interviews.md`

- there is a new slack workspace

- class recordings will be zipped and sent out there once class is done

- you already have the class repo locally, probably push it to a private repo

- after graduation

  - I recommend spending a week or two of rest

    - followed by a few months of study for these interviews

      - use each other, mock interview one another - it's helpful for both parties

- stay connected, networking is incredibly important

- send my email, LinkedIn and the slack workspace

- I will also recommend anyone on LinkedIn, let me know if you would like my recommendation

  - unlikely to get to it soon

- I want to stay connected. Please reach out to me with updates, let me know if you want to chat about anything or get advice.

  - everyone here means a tremendous amount to me. I don't want this to be the end of our relationship. Everyone please stay in touch!

- reunion happy hour next Friday
