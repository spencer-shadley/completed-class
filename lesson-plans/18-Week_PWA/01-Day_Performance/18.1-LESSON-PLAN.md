# 18.1 - Web Performance

Ends early, can take more time with explanations

Last activity would be most beneficial to extend time on

### Ins: Welcome/Intro Web Performance

- 630-40 (10 min)

- We're going to focus on web performance

  - Lighthouse auditing

  - Minification

  - Compression

  - lazy loading

- we're going to use project 2 for these tests

- ask for someone's favorite website

  - load it in Slow 3G with the network tab open (disable cache too)

    - explain throttling

  - hover on one of the bars to get color legend

  - lots of stuff is just waiting because browsers only support about 6 concurrent connections to handle requests

    - could improve by having fewer requests

  - lots of stuff takes a long time to download

    - could improve by making stuff smaller

- show ins demo 0

### Ins: Demo Lighthouse

- 640-50 (10 min)

- Demo `05-Stu_Gallery-Lazy-Load`

  - Google has created a tool called Lighthouse which will allow us to run an audit on our page and find out different metrics about how it performs and what is hindering its performance. Lighthouse is a quality auditing tool developed by Google for analyzing web pages.

  - It provides audits for performance, accessibility, SEO, and progressive web applications.

  - Lighthouse can be run directly from our Chrome Dev Tools. This makes it a fast, simple, and effective way to get insights into our pages overall performance metrics.

  - Open chrome dev tools, and click the `Audits` tab.

  - Scroll down and click `Run Audits`

    - Performance - what we're focusing on today

    - Accessibility - can a blind person use your site? Someone with color blindness?

    - Best Practices - various standards are checked for

    - SEO

    - PWA

    - Contentful paint: any content is loaded - first time text or image is shown

    - Meaningful paint: primary content is shown

    - Time to interactive: webpage becomes usable

- Ask: what can lighthouse help with?

  - Identifying places to optimize

- Ask: when should we run it?

  - frequently

### Stu: 01-Stu_Lighthouse

- 650-658 (8 min)

- Run lighthouse on project 2

### Ins: Review

- 658-703 (5 min)

- Ask:

  - What are some of the 'Opportunities' for improvement you found in your applications?

  - How long did the first content paint take?

  - How long did the first meaningful paint take?

  - How long did it take to become interactive?

- Are there any commonalities you hear?

### Ins: JS Minification

- 703-13 (10 min)

- Ask: What is minification?

  - Removing unnecessary things like whitespace and making variable names smaller

  - [jquery source](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.js)

    - if printed it would take 170 pages

    - 274KB

  - [jquery minfied](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js)

    - if printed it would take 17 pages

    - 87KB

- Open [JavaScript Minifier](https://javascript-minifier.com/) and paste the following code into the textarea:

  ```js
  const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  for (let increment = 0; increment < myArray.length; ++increment) {
    console.log(myArray[increment]);
  }
  ```

  - 145 characters => 83 characters (43% smaller)

- Ask the class, "What are the benefits of minification?"

- When would we want a file to be minified? Do we even still want the non-minified version?

  - We probably want both, non-minified for developing and minified and for production

  - we store minified files in a directory called `dist`, generally (distribution)

### Stu: Minify your JavaScript

- 713-23 (10 min) (add time if running ahead)

- Direct students to the activity instructions located in [02-Stu_Minifiy-JS]

### Ins: Review

- 723-28 (5 min)

- Ask: Who got at least 10%, 20%, etc.

### Ins: Compression npm package

- 728-38 (10 min)

- This is JavaScript but images tend to be much larger. Can we minify them too?

- Ask the class, "What is a zip file?"

  - A `.zip` file is a compressed version of a normal directory. When you `unzip` it, the directory contains all of the information it had before it was zipped.

    - we're going to do this on the web to save on payload

    - but we're going to `gzip`, an alternative for comrpessing/decompressing files which is standard for unix, linux and mac

    - HTTP supports decompressing gzip directly

- we're going to use an npm middleware package to compress things like images

  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression

  - live demo compressing `14-full-stack\3-saturday-relationships\activities\15-Post-Author-Joins\Solved`

    - `npm i --save compression`

    - `const compression = require('compression');`

    - `app.use(compression());`

- show in network the compressed file sizes

### Stu: 03-Stu_Enable-Compression

- 738-48 (10 min) extend by 5 minutes if running ahead

### Ins: Review

- 748-53 (5 min)

- did any questions come up?

### BREAK

- 753-808 (15 min)

### Stu: 04-Stu_Image-Compression

- 808-813 (5 min)

- images are relatively huge and often a bottleneck

- let's use lossy compression (information is lost during compression which cannot be recovered)

  - mp3 v flac

  - jpg v png

### Ins: Review

- 813-18 (5 min)

- Did you see a loss in image quality?

  - Image compression allows us to lower load times for our users without a loss of visual fidelity.

- What are some other things we can do to decrease our load times?

  - We can load only images that are present on the screen. If the image is not visible to the user, we shouldn't bother downloading it yet.

- Ask the class, "What if a user doesn't scroll through all of the images?"

  - Now that we have compressed all of our images, we are certainly saving space. Point out, we are loading all 38 images when there is only 6-9 images showing at any time. If a students user is on mobile, it would only be 1-2 images at any time.

  - This poses multiple problems. It not only makes loading slower, but is costly when it comes to data and those people using mobile who may not have an unlimited data plan. We certainly don't want to cost our user time and money, so what can be done?

- Ask the class, "Why do we load all of the images at page load, if the user might not see them all?"

  - Loading everything at once is the default. There is a concept in programming referred to as `lazy loading` that allows us to only download assets as they are needed.

### Ins: Lazy Loading

- 818-28 (10 min)

- demo `05-Stu_Gallery-Lazy-Load`

  - as we scroll the images are lazily loaded

  - ask if they can tell it is lazy?

    - try it with slow 3G

- Ask the class, "What would enable us to know when an image is coming into the users viewport?"

  - A Web API based on `scroll` events and the viewport intersection would allow us to keep an eye on when an element is or is not in view of our user.

  - In the case of this application, we are loading 38 images when we may not need them all. Using lazy loading, If images were scrolled onto the screen that event would then load the images if they had entered the viewport.

- An existing Web API called `Intersection Observer` can do this

  - Enables observing when an element is within the viewport

  - built using the `Observer` pattern (subjects - images and observer - intersection)

    - like a magazine

      - publisher (subject) publishes magazines

      - consumer (observer) are interested you subscribe

      - consumer (observer) is uninterested you unsubscribe

      - publisher doesn't know how you use the magazine, it just delivers it to you

      - draw this example if possible

    - enables a loosely coupled one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state everyone stays informed and up-to-date

- `public\assets\js\loadImages.js`

- alternative is using the `loading="lazy"` attribute

  - https://caniuse.com/#search=loading

  - `<img src="someImage.png" loading="lazy">`

  - demo by...

    - getting rid of function

    - removing setAttribute for src

    - adding `` img.setAttribute(`src`, image.image); ``

    - adding `` img.setAttribute(`loading`, `lazy`); ``

- Ask the class, "How does this benefit our user?"

  - By loading only necessary images, we can cut download/load times consistently and ensure as fast an experience as possible.
