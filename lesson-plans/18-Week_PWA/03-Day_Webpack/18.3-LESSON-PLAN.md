# 18.3 - Intro to Webpack (10:00 AM)

### Ins: Welcome/Intro Webpack

- 10-1010 (10 min)

- today we will cover how we bundle JavaScript files using Webpack to improve performance

- what have we leaned to help with perf so far?

  - compression, minification, lazy-loading and caching

  - do we minify by hand every time we make a change? (of course not - annoying and what if we have dependencies)

  - if you remember that we were network bottlenecked at about 6 requests, how can we fix that?

    - bundle multiple files into a single file

- webpack analyzes the dependencies of your project to create one ore more bundles

- if you remember, browsers can only handle so many concurrent connections (about 6)

  - bundling our javascript files reduces the number of network requests

  - having something automatically combine them prevents us from having to develop in a monolith

  - modules are going to become standard in JS but are not well-developed yet (ESM - ECMAScript Modules)

  - can be extended to support more than JS (CSS, HTML, etc.)

  - supports transpilation with babel

  - supports tree shaking

  - minification

  - hot reloading

  - more

### Ins: 15-Ins-Webpack-Intro

- 1010-15 (5 min)

- Install webpack dev dependencies

  - `npm i -D webpack webpack-cli`

  - show `package.json`

    - add `"build": "webpack --watch"` to have webpack build our project anytime files change

- `webpack.config.js`

  - webpack uses a config file for its options, we will spend a significant amount of time tweaking this today

  - `entry` the main JavaScript file from which a dependency graph can be generated

    - show `src/app.js`

  - `output` how to output bundles

  - `mode` allows us to have different configs for production and development

    - ask: why would we want this? (optimize readability in development, optimize performance in production)

- run `webpack`

  - creates `dist/bundle.js`

  - it looked at `app.js` and setup a dependency graph

    - right now `app.js` does not require anything so the graph is a single node - we'll update that in a bit

  - lots of webpack setup at the top and then our `console.log` at the bottom

  - it generated this using a dependency graph starting at `app.js`

- `index.html`

  - we don't have to specify each file individually any more, just a reference to the bundled set of files

  - open the file (we see the log)

  - show the sources

  - change the log

### Stu: 16-Stu-Webpack-Intro

- 1015-25 (10 min)

### Instructor Do: Review

- (5 min)

- Open `13-Stu-Webpack-Intro/Solved/` in the browser and demonstrate the following functionality:

  - When we add multiple expenses, we see that our balance adjusts for each submission.

  - When we click the reset button, the expenses list gets cleared and the balance is reset to its original value.

- Open `13-Stu-Webpack-Intro/Solved/app.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - At the top of the file, we bring in `module.exports` from the calculations file.

  - Webpack allows us to use modules, including the `require` module just like we can in Node.js apps.

  - If we were not using Webpack, we wouldn't be able to use `require` in client-side JavaScript.

  ```js
  const calculations = require('./calculations');
  ```

  - Our subtract function needs to parse `balanceEl.innerText` from a String to a Number before perfoming the `-` operation.

```js
function submit() {
  const total = calculations.subtract(
    Number(balanceEl.innerText),
    priceEl.value
  );
  balanceEl.innerText = total;
  addToList(expenseEl.value, priceEl.value);
}

function reset() {
  const total = 2000;
  balanceEl.innerText = total;
  expensesListEl.innerHTML = '';
}
```

- Open `webpack.config.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - We use the same configuration as the previous demo.

- Open `package.json` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - We use the same configuration as the previous demo.

  - Which JavaScript file do we link to index.html?

  - Our JavaScript bundle, `./dist/bundle.js`

### Ins: Demo Bundle Analyzer Plugin

- (5 min)

- Open `14-Ins-First-Plugin/package.json` in your IDE and explain the following:

  - We've added webpack-bundle-analyzer to our devDependencies and the chart.js library to our dependencies.

  - The `webpack-bundle-analyzer` is a plugin that will build an interactive visualization of all of the dependencies in our project.

- Open `14-Ins-First-Plugin/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - Webpack plugins can be used to perform tasks that Webpack can't perform by default. Some of these tasks include asset management, additional bundle optimization, and adding PWA capabilities.

  - Plugins could be used multiple times in the same configuration file, so it is important that you create an instance of one by using the keyword `new`.

- Open `14-Ins-First-Plugin/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - Emphasize that we've simply added a library so that we can analyze its impact on the total bundle size.

- Run `npm run build` from the command line, navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888) in your browser if the tab does not automatically open and explain the following:

- This plugin helps us analyze the different impacts that libraries have on the bundle size of our application.

- When we mouse over the `bundle.js` section, then the `chart.js` section we can see that the chart.js library makes up a significant portion of our total bundle size.

- Why is `moment.js` included here, even though we didn't install it?

- Even though we didn't explicitly install `moment.js`, it is a dependency of `chart.js`, and adds to the total bundle size of our application.

### Stu: Gallery App with Webpack

- (10 min)

```md
# Gallery App with Webpack

In this activity we will adjust our Gallery app so that Webpack minifies and bundles our code.

## Instructions

- Before you begin, make sure to install all of the necessary dependencies with `npm install`.

- Run the following command: `npm install sw-precache-webpack-plugin webpack-pwa-manifest -D`.

- In a separate tab in your terminal, start a mongodb server with `mongod`.

- Run `npm start` to make sure that the application works as expected.

- Using the entry point of `src/app.js`, make Webpack output a bundle file in a directory called `dist/`.

- In `index.html`, change the JavaScript file src to be your new bundle file.

- Add the script `"prestart": "npm run webpack",` to the scripts in `package.json` so that Webpack will build every time the application is started.

- Update this application to accomplish the following:

  - Create a file in `public/` using `serviceWorker.js` from previous gallery pwa activity.

  - In `serviceWorker.js`, update the `FILES_TO_CACHE` array with files generated from Webpack.

### Bonus

- Install the bundle analyzer plugin and identify which modules contribute the most to the total bundle size.

### Hints

- Try clearing application storage and disabling cache after making changes to your application. If it appears to be working, use Chrome DevTools to toggle `offline mode` and ensure that the application uses the service worker.
```

### Ins: Review

- (5 min)

- Run the following commands to start the application:

```bash
node seeders/seed.js
npm install
npm start
```

- Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and point out the following:

  - If we inspect our Service Worker with DevTools, we see that `dist/bundle.js` is cached.

  - Additionally, "Service Worker registered successfully" was logged to the console.

- Open `public/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - The first plugin, `SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin` allows us to cache our external project dependencies. It generates a service worker using an existing service worker and adds it to our build directory.

  - The second plugin, `WebpackPwaManifest` generates a manifest.json file to be included in our build directory. While most of the properties are the same as a regular manifest.json, this plugin also automatically resizes all of our icons to the appropriate sizes and allows for the use of ES6 features and JavaScript comments.

```js
plugins: [
  new SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin({
    cacheId: "my-domain-cache-id",
    dontCacheBustUrlsMatching: /\.\w{8}\./,
    filename: "service-worker.js",
    minify: true,
    staticFileGlobsIgnorePatterns: [/\.map$/, /manifest\.json$/]
  }),
  new WebpackPwaManifest({
    name: "Images App",
    short_name: "Images App",
    description: "An application for images",
    background_color: "#01579b",
    theme_color: "#ffffff",
    "theme-color": "#ffffff",
    start_url: "/",
    icons: [
      {
        src: path.resolve("public/assets/images/icons/android-chrome-192x192.png"),
        sizes: [96, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512],
        destination: path.join("assets", "icons")
      }
    ]
  })
],
```

- Open `package.json` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - Our plugins must be installed as devDependencies.

  - We've also added the script "prestart", which is a built in npm script that will automatically run before each time `npm start` is run.

### Ins: Demo Pure Functions

- (10 min)

- The next demo is going to use a couple of ES6 features that aren't supported in all browsers.

  - What tool do you think we will need to use to allow us to use ES6 in all browsers?

  - Babel. This is true, but in order to use Babel with our Webpack build we will need to utilize a Babel feature known as a **loader**.

  - Normally, Webpack only knows how to process regular JavaScript. Loaders allow Webpack to compile and bundle non-JavaScript resources like CSS, HTML, TypeScript, and more. Specifically, the Babel loader goes through all of our JavaScript files and transpiles ES6 into ES5.

- Open `16-Ins-Pure-Functions/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - We've created a new object called module and within it define an array of rules.

  - `test` is a regular expression that describes the files that you want to match.

  - Since Babel loader is pretty slow, it is especially important that you define an `exclude` property that contains a regular expression that matches all files in your `node_modules` directory.

  - The `use` property is where we define which loader we are going to use, along with any presets or configurations to pass to the loader. Here, we are telling Webpack to use the babel-loader for all JavaScript files that are not in `node_modules`, and to use a preset called `@babel/preset-env`.

```js
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.m?js$/,
      exclude: /(node_modules)/,
      use: {
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        options: {
          presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
        }
      }
    }
  ];
}
```

- Now that we've added our loader, we need to install Babel itself, the loader, and any presets that we want to use.

- Run `npm install @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env -D` from the command line.

- Open up `src/app.js` and point out the reorganization of the files.

- We have added the `Chart.js` library so that we can see a bar chart of our expenses.

  - Remember, Webpack allows us to import other npm modules into our application.

  - We've separated the files into files like `elements.js` and `expenses.js` to help further modularize our code. There is no definitively "right" way to split up your code. The main goal when refactoring code to be split between files is to create functions that are reusable and relatively "pure", when possible.

  - What does it mean for a function to be pure?

  - Pure functions are straightforward with singular purposes. They do not have any "side effects" within them. **Side effects** are bits of code that interact with the outside world like database calls or changes to the DOM.

  - In pure functions, whenever data needs to be modified, it is not mutated. Instead, we create a new variable that describes the new mutation. Pure functions have the advantage of being easily testable and reusable. It is considered best practice to use pure functions whenever possible.

  - What does it mean for a function to be impure?

  - Impure functions tend to have multiple purposes. The might contain database or network calls. Even though it is preferred to keep your functions simple, impure functions are often unavoidable.

- Open `src/calculations.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - The `subtract` function is a pure function. It creates a new variable for the result, instead of modifying the input and contains no side effects.

  ```js
  export function subtract(a, b) {
    const result = a - b;
    return result;
  }
  ```

- Open `src/app.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - The `submit` function is an impure function. It modifies existing values and has multiple side effects.

  ```js
  function submit() {
    const total = subtract(Number(balanceEl.innerText), priceEl.value);
    balanceEl.innerText = total;
    addToList(expenseEl.value, priceEl.value);
    updateChart(expensesChart, expenseEl.value, priceEl.value);
  }
  ```

- Run `npm install` in your terminal and open `index.html` file in your browser and demonstrate the following functionality:

  - The submit button adds new expenses to the list.

  - The chart is updated with the new expenses.

### Stu: Gallery Pure Functions

- (15 min)

```md
# Gallery Pure Functions

In this activity we will adjust our Gallery app so that Webpack minifies and bundles our code.

## Instructions

- Run `npm install`.

- Using the ES6 import/export syntax, separate functions out into separate JavaScript files to make your application more modular.

- While there are many ways that you can separate your JavaScript files, it is recommended that you create somethings similar to the following file structure:

  - `app.js` Loads images and calls the `createCards` function.

  - `cardCreation.js` Responsible for all functions related to the creation of cards.

  - `domMethods.js` Responsible for all functions related to manipulating the DOM.

  - `hover.js` Responsible for the hover effect functions.

  - `rating.js` Handles the creation of the ratings form and the update method.

- Adjust the files in the `FILES_TO_CACHE` array within `public/service-worker.js` so that the Webpack bundle is cached instead.

- Run `npm start` and make sure that the application still works as expected.
```

### Ins: Review

- (10 min)

### Ins: Demo Lazy Loading JavaScript

- (10 min)

- Tell the class that just like the lazy loading they worked with using Images, JavaScript can also be loaded as needed.

  - What is lazy loading?

  - Lazy loading allows us to load resources on an as-needed basis, instead of on page load.

  - If there is JavaScript specific to a part of the page a user is using, when do you think it should be downloaded?

  - We should only download the JavaScript specific to a part of the page when the user navigates to that page.

  - Could deferring the downloading save us time on page load?

  - Absolutely. Longer bundle sizes result in longer load times.

- Open `18-Ins-Chunking/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - We have added a second entry point to our bundle. This entry point is `chart`.

  - `chart` points to `./src/expenseChart.js`.

  - `filename: "[name].bundle.js"` dynamically names our bundle after the name of the entry point. For instance, the entry point `chart` will create a bundle named `chart.bundle.js`.

  - By creating multiple entry points, we can defer the loading of a particular bundle until the code required is needed.

- Open `chart.html` and point out the following:

  - We've added a `<script>` tag to our html that loads our `chart.js` JavaScript bundle.

```html
<script src="./dist/chart.bundle.js"></script>
```

- Open `07-Ins-Chunking` in your IDE and run the following commands from your command line:

  - `npm install`

  - `npm run build`

- Open the `index.html` in your browser and point out the following:

  - If we inspect out Network in DevTools, we can see that the chart.js has not been loaded yet.

  - Only once we click the `chart` link in the navbar of the page does the `chart.js` bundle load.

  - What are the possible setbacks of this method?

  - If both of our bundles require some of the same dependencies, those will be included and both bundles and thus we will end up with duplicated code between bundles.

### Stu: Gallery Lazy Loading JavaScript

- (15 min)

- Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu-Chunking`

```md
- Run `npm install`.

- In `webpack.config.js`, add entry points for JavaScript files for the three pages, home, detail, and favorites.

- Update `service-worker.js` file so that it caches the new bundles.

- Make sure to update each html file so that it also uses the appropriate bundle.

- Note that the gallery application has been upgraded with the ability to save your favorite images to IndexedDb.

- Once again, there are many ways that you can separate your JavaScript files. It is recommended that you create somethings similar to the following file structure to avoid chunking unused code:

  - `api.js` Loads images from the api.

  - `cardCreation.js` Responsible for all functions related to the creation of cards.

  - `domMethods.js` Responsible for all functions related to manipulating the DOM.

  - `detail.js` Responsible for the Detail page of the application.

  - `favorites.js` Responsible for the Favorites page of the application.

  - `home.js` Responsible for the Home page of the application.

  - `indexedDb.js` Contains a helper method to interact with IndexedDb.

  - `rating.js` Handles the creation of the ratings form and the update method.

- Adjust the files in the `FILES_TO_CACHE` array within `public/service-worker.js` so that the Webpack bundle is cached instead.

- Run `npm start` and make sure that the application still works as expected.

- Navigate to each page and make sure that the bundle files are all being cached by the service worker.

### Hints

- Try testing out functionality of the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) every time you make changes. This will help you identify the code that does not work as expected.

- If extracting functionality from a JavaScript file causes any of the pages to stop working, do **not** continue until you understand why it's not working as expected.

- Ask the instructor or a TA for help if get stuck or are unsure why a function isn't working.
```

### Ins: Review

- (10 min)

- Open `22-Stu-Chunking/Solved/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  - There are now three entry points designated.

  ```js
  entry: {
          app: './public/assets/js/home.js',
          detail: './public/assets/js/detail.js',
          favorites: './public/assets/js/favorites.js'
      },
  ```

  - We also used the `[name].bundle.js` syntax in our output to dynamically name our bundle after the entry point it was built from.

  ```js
  output: {
          path: __dirname + '/public/dist',
          filename: '[name].bundle.js',
      },
  ```

- Now run the following commands from the command line:

  - `npm install`

  - `npm run watch`

  - In the console, we have 3 `bundle.js` files and the bundle naming aligns with the entry points provided in the `webpack.config.js`

- Run the following command from the command line: `npm run webpack`

- In your browser, navigate to [localhost](https://localhost:3000) and explain the following:

  - If we open up our `Network` tab and toggle JS, we can click a picture's name and see that `detail.bundle.js` is loaded when we bring the details of an image.

- In your browser, click on the link to the favorites page and point out the following:

  - `favorites.bundle.js` loads.

  - Lazy loading is a great way to defer loading of resources that are not necessary, but there are possible problems it can raise.

  - Most notably, if multiple entry points have some of the same dependencies, those dependencies will be duplicated across bundles.

### BREAK

- (40 min)

### Ins: Introduce Mini-Project

- (5 min)

- Run the following commands from the command line:

  - `npm install`

  - `npm run watch`

- Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and point out the following:

  - Newsy is a news aggregator app that allows us to search for articles classified by topic, then save our favorites.

  - The home page of the application has some default topics, but we can create your own or remove the default topics.

  - Clicking on one of the topics causes the page to display a list and allows us to save each article to our favorites.

  - Saving a couple of articles to our favorites causes the button to update to a _remove_ button.

  - Navigate to the favorites page in your browser and point out the following:

    - The favorites we selected are listed.

    - The favorites data was stored in IndexedDb, since we are not using a local database for this application.

# 16. Student Do: Work on Mini-Project

- (60 min)

```md
# PWA Mini-Project

In this activity we will take an existing news aggregator application and transform it into a PWA that can be installed on a user's device. We will also utilize webpack's minify and chunking features to help reduce the total size of the application.

## Instructions

- Open the [Unsolved](Unsolved) directory and install dependencies by running `npm install` at the project root.

- Start the app by running `npm run watch` from the project root.

- Once the app starts open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

- Open [index.js](Unsolved/assets/js/index.js).

- There are 3 main sections in this application:

  - A section that allows you to manage a list of topics.

  - A section that displays different articles of a given topic. This page will also allow you to save articles to your favorites.

  - A favorites page to view a list of the user's favorite articles. This page also allows the user to remove articles from their favorites.

### Part 1

- In the `client/` directory, create a `package.json` file either with the command `npm init` or using a `package.json` from a previous activity.

- Using the `webpack.config.js` from the previous activities, create a new `webpack.config.js` file that uses a babel loader and the necessary plugins to transform the application to a PWA.

- Create an entry point for each file in `assets/js`.

- Create a `service-worker.js` and make sure to cache all of the bundle files.

### Part 2

- Take a moment to study the contents of `index.js`:

  1. `renderTopics()` renders all of the topics to the page using `createTopics`.

  2. `topicData` is an array of predefined topics to populate the page with.

  3. `createElement()` allows you to create a document element using the a string of its type, and object containing its attributes, and children elements.

- Since `createElement` is a general purpose function that we can use throughout our application, we are going to create a separate file to keep it in named `domMethods`. By doing this, we will be able to import `createElement` into any component we would like without duplicating code.

- Take a moment to study the contents of `topic.js`:

  1. Remove the `createElement` function and modify the file to use the `createElement` from `domMethods.js`.

  2. Extract the code necessary for indexedDb into its own file and be sure to import it into `topic.js`.

  3. Extract the `loadArticles` function to a new file called API and be sure to import any of its dependencies.

- Take a moment to study the contents of `favorites.js`:

  1. Remove the all function declarations for utilities, indexedDb, API, and domMethods.

  2. Using ES6 syntax, import all necessary functions.

### Hints

- You will **not** have to modify any files that are not in the `client` directory.

- Ask the instructor or a TA if you're having difficulty understanding any of the activity requirements.
```

# 17. Instructor Do: Review Mini-Project

- (15 min)

- Open `index.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - All of the functions pertaining to the `home` page are in `index.js`.

  - `createElement` is brought in from the `domMethods.js` file.

- Open `domMethod.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - It is not entirely necessary for us to understand exactly how every line in `createElement` works.

  - It is valuable to get practice working with code we do not fully understand because new developers almost always start their careers working with an unfamiliar codebase.

  - The `createElement` function returns a DOM element and has the following parameters:

  1. A string that represents the type of element.

  2. An object containing all of the attributes to add to the element.

  3. 1 or more children elements to be appended to the element.

  - The `createArticle` function uses a ternary expression to render a `Save to Favorites` button or a `Remove from Favorites` button depending on whether the article is already part of the user's favorites.

  - `loadPage` is a callback passed to the `createElement`. The actual function will either use the results from an AJAX request or the results from IndexedDb to render the page, depending on which function was passed through as a callback.

  ```js
  !favorite
    ? createElement(
      "button",
      {
        class: "button button--primary",
        onclick: () => {
          useIndexedDb("articles", "ArticleStore", "put", {
            source,
            author,
            title,
            description,
            url,
            urlToImage,
            publishedAt,
            _id
          });
          loadPage();
        }
      },
      "Save to Favorites"
    )
  ```

  - `createPlaceholders()` displays placeholders so that content is rendered on the page while the user waits for results from the AJAX request. Although they will only display on the page for a few seconds, they play a significant role in increasing the user's experience on the site.

  ```js
  // Create and return 4 placeholder articles
  function createPlaceholders() {
    const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();

    for (let i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
      const placeholder = createPlaceholder();
      fragment.appendChild(placeholder);
    }

    return fragment;
  }

  // Returns markup for a placeholder article
  function createPlaceholder() {
    return createElement(
      'div',
      { class: 'article-skeleton' },
      createElement(
        'div',
        { class: 'article-skeleton__header' },
        createElement('div', { class: 'article-skeleton__title' }),
        createElement('div', { class: 'article-skeleton__published' })
      ),
      createElement(
        'div',
        { class: 'article-skeleton__content' },
        createElement('div', { class: 'article-skeleton__image' }),
        createElement('div', { class: 'article-skeleton__text' }),
        createElement('div', { class: 'article-skeleton__text' }),
        createElement('div', { class: 'article-skeleton__text' }),
        createElement('div', { class: 'article-skeleton__text' }),
        createElement('div', { class: 'article-skeleton__text' })
      )
    );
  }
  ```

- Open `topic.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  - When the `Topic` page is opened, `useIndexedDb` is called to check if any of the articles have been favorited. This is necessary so that articles that have already been saved to the user's favorites can display a `Remove from Favorites` button.

```js
import { useIndexedDb } from './indexedDb';
import { loadArticles } from './API';
import { renderArticles } from './domMethods';
// Call renderArticles on page load
function loadPage() {
  useIndexedDb('articles', 'ArticleStore', 'get').then(results => {
    const favorites = results;
    loadArticles().then(data => {
      const mappedData = data.map(article => {
        article.favorite = false;
        favorites.forEach(fav => {
          if (article._id === fav._id) {
            article.favorite = true;
          }
        });
        return article;
      });
      renderArticles(mappedData, loadPage);
    });
  });
}

- Open `service-worker.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - Each html file should be cached with its respective bundle.

```js
const FILES_TO_CACHE = [
  '/',
  '/index.html',
  '/favorites.html',
  '/topic.html',
  '/assets/css/style.css',
  '/dist/app.bundle.js',
  '/dist/favorites.bundle.js',
  '/dist/topic.bundle.js'
];
```

- Open `webpack.config.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - There are 3 different entry points created for each app.

  - Each bundle will include all dependencies brought into each entry file with ES6 `import`.

```js
entry: {
    app: "./assets/js/index.js",
    favorites: "./assets/js/favorites.js",
    topic: "./assets/js/topic.js"
  },
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/dist",
    filename: "[name].bundle.js"
  },
```

- Although most of the configuration can vary, depending on the app, it's important that the icon `src` points to a valid path to an icon for the application.

```js
plugins: [
  new SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin({
    cacheId: 'my-domain-cache-id',
    dontCacheBustUrlsMatching: /\.\w{8}\./,
    filename: 'service-worker.js',
    minify: true,
    staticFileGlobsIgnorePatterns: [/\.map$/, /manifest\.json$/]
  }),
  new WebpackPwaManifest({
    name: 'Newsy app',
    short_name: 'Newsy',
    description:
      'An application that allows you to view different news articles and save your favorites.',
    background_color: '#01579b',
    theme_color: '#ffffff',
    'theme-color': '#ffffff',
    start_url: '/',
    icons: [
      {
        src: path.resolve('assets/images/icons/android-chrome-192x192.png'),
        sizes: [96, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512],
        destination: path.join('assets', 'icons')
      }
    ]
  })
];
```

- If time permits, ask the students if there are any parts of the application that they would like to spend more time going over.

  - Some students may be frustrated with the amount of time they needed to spend refactoring code so that it could be easily chunked by webpack.

  - If this is the case, remind students that one of the main motivations behind chunking is reducing the bundle size of your code. While there are many strategies one can take to split up their code, it is important that it's split in a way that makes the code reusable and clear in purpose. Sometimes this means large amounts of refactoring functions. This is time well spent since they are making their code easier to test and easier for other developers to work with.
