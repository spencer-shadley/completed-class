# 18.3 - Intro to Webpack (10:00 AM)

### Ins: Welcome/Intro Webpack

- 10-1010 (10 min)

- today we will cover how we bundle JavaScript files using Webpack to improve performance

- what have we leaned to help with perf so far?

  - compression, minification, lazy-loading and caching

  - do we minify by hand every time we make a change? (of course not - annoying and what if we have dependencies)

  - if you remember that we were network bottlenecked at about 6 requests, how can we fix that?

    - bundle multiple files into a single file

- webpack analyzes the dependencies of your project to create one ore more bundles

- if you remember, browsers can only handle so many concurrent connections (about 6)

  - bundling our javascript files reduces the number of network requests

  - having something automatically combine them prevents us from having to develop in a monolith

  - modules are going to become standard in JS but are not well-developed yet (ESM - ECMAScript Modules)

  - can be extended to support more than JS (CSS, HTML, etc.)

  - supports transpilation with babel

  - supports tree shaking

  - minification

  - hot reloading

  - more

### Ins: 15-Ins-Webpack-Intro

- 1010-15 (5 min)

- Install webpack dev dependencies

  - `npm i -D webpack webpack-cli`

  - show `package.json`

    - add `"build": "webpack --watch"` to have webpack build our project anytime files change

- `webpack.config.js`

  - webpack uses a config file for its options, we will spend a significant amount of time tweaking this today

  - `entry` the main JavaScript file from which a dependency graph can be generated

    - show `src/app.js`

  - `output` how to output bundles

  - `mode` allows us to have different configs for production and development

    - ask: why would we want this? (optimize readability in development, optimize performance in production)

- run `webpack`

  - creates `dist/bundle.js`

  - it looked at `app.js` and setup a dependency graph

    - right now `app.js` does not require anything so the graph is a single node - we'll update that in a bit

  - lots of webpack setup at the top and then our `console.log` at the bottom

  - it generated this using a dependency graph starting at `app.js`

- `index.html`

  - we don't have to specify each file individually any more, just a reference to the bundled set of files

  - open the file (we see the log)

  - show the sources

  - change the log

- add a dependency

  - `src/pizza.js`

    ```js
    'use strict';

    function eat(numPizzas) {
      console.log(`Ate ${numPizzas} pizzas!`);
    }

    module.exports = {
      eat
    };
    ```

  - `src/app.js`

    ```js
    'use strict';

    const pizza = require(`./pizza`);

    console.log(`Hello webpack!`);
    pizza.eat(10);
    ```

### Stu: 16-Stu-Webpack-Intro

- 1015-25 (10 min)

- try adding webpack to a budgeting website

### Instructor Do: Review

- 1025-30 (5 min)

- show `package.json`, `webpack.config.js`

- `app.js` depends on `calculations.js` (require and export kind of like node)

  - without webpack we would not be able to do this `require` in the client-side

- in `dist/bundle.js` it takes this dependency graph into account

  - we can see a `__webpack_require__` to pull in calculations

### Ins: 17-Ins-First-Plugin

- 1030-35 (5 min)

- plugins and loaders are the two main pieces of webpack we will work with, let's add a plugin to visualize the size of our project

- according to webpack "Plugins are the backbone of webpack"

  - they enable third parties to add functionality to webpack that aren't built-in by default. There are thousands of plug-ins which do everything from asset management, bundle optimization to adding PWA capabilities.

- show `package.json`

- show `webpack.config.js`

- `npm run build`

  - `webpack-bundle-analyzer` will auto open http://127.0.0.1:8888 with a treemap

  - using `webpack-bundle-analyzer` we can see the impact libraries have on the bundle size

    - `stat size`: source size before transformations

    - `parsed size`: output size

    - `gzip`: after compression

- most of our code are dependencies like `chart.js`

- `moment.js` is a dependency on `chart.js` so it gets included as well

### Stu: 18-Stu-Webpack-Plugin

- 1035-50 (15 min)

### Ins: Review

- 1050-55 (5 min)

- `package.json`

  - `npm run init`

  - `npm run start`

- show the app runs

- `webpack.config.js`

  - `procuction` minifies bundle - show that in chrome

  - `WebpackPwaManifest` plugin to generate `public/dist/manifest.json` - show application tab and `public/assets/dist/manifest.json`

- `service-worker.js`

  - added `dist` assets

  - network shows it being cached by the service worker

### Ins: 19-Ins-Pure-Functions

- 1055-1105 (10 min)

- there are a bunch of features in new versions of JavaScript that would be great to use but we have to support the lowest-common-denominator browser (IE or Safari)

- we can use transpilation for browsers that don't support the latest features - have something automatically convert the code to something the browser will understand

- now that we are using webpack it's pretty easy to add the babel _loader_

- by default webpack knows how to process javascript

- loaders enable compiling, bundling and adjusting other resources (CSS, HTML, TypeScript, some-custom-file, etc.)

- we can use babel to transpile our code from ES6 to ES5

- `webpack.config.js`

  - added module rules

  - `test` is RegEx for what files we want this to run on

    - `babel-loader` is slow - make sure this is as restrictive as possible and the `exclude`

  - `use` to define the loader which run for these files and optionally some options

- `package.json`

  - includes `@babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env`

- now we can use modern conventions like `import` even in old browsers like IE

  - https://caniuse.com/#search=JavaScript%20modules%3A%20dynamic%20import

### Stu: 20-Stu-Babel

- 1105-20 (15 min)

### Ins: Review

- 1120-30 (10 min)

- `package.json`

  - dependencies and scripts

- `webpack.config.json`

- `export`/`import` in each file

- split files into multiple pieces

  - `app.js` depends on `cardCreation` which depends on `domMethods` and `ratings`

- `service-worker.js` `FILES_TO_CACHE` has the bundles

### Ins: 21-Ins-Chunking

- 1130-40 (10 min)

- now that things are modular we have more granularity over when we want them to load

- let's do some lazy loading as we did previously with images, but now with JavaScript

- this should improve load speed significantly

- `webpack.config.js`

  - we now have a second entry point - `app` and `chart`

  - in our `output` we can get the name of the file it is parsing with `[name]`

    - this will create `chart.bundle.js` and `app.bundle.js`

    - we can now load each of these separately

- `chart.html` will load the chart bundle javascript

- `index.html` will load the app bundle javascript

- run the app (`npm run build`)

  - open `index.html`

    - we see only `app.bundle.js` is loaded

  - Only once we click the `chart` link in the navbar of the page does the `chart.js` bundle load

  - when we click `chart.bundle.js` then we get its bundle

- ask: what are the downsides to doing this?

  - if both bundles share dependencies those will be duplicated

### Stu: 22-Stu-Chunking

- 1140-55 (15 min)

### Ins: Review

- 1155-1205 (10 min)

- `webpack.config.js`

  - three entry points (app, detail, favorites)

  - output is `[name].bundle.js`

- `npm run seed`

- `npm run build`

- `npm run start`

- open https://localhost:3000

  - "Home" vs "Favorites" vs "Detail" loads different bundles

### BREAK

- 1205-45 (40 min)

### Ins: Introduce 23-Stu-Mini-Project

- 1245-50 (5 min)

- NOTE: there are two `package.json` - client and server

- demo the app

  - show that the bundles are different

  - this uses indexeddb for storing data

  - loads offline as well

### Stu: 23-Stu-Mini-Project

### Ins: 23-Stu-Mini-Project

- 150-2 (10 min)

- Open `index.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - All of the functions pertaining to the `home` page are in `index.js`.

  - `createElement` is brought in from the `domMethods.js` file.

- Open `domMethod.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - It is not entirely necessary for us to understand exactly how every line in `createElement` works.

  - It is valuable to get practice working with code we do not fully understand because new developers almost always start their careers working with an unfamiliar codebase.

  - The `createElement` function returns a DOM element and has the following parameters:

  1. A string that represents the type of element.

  2. An object containing all of the attributes to add to the element.

  3. 1 or more children elements to be appended to the element.

  - The `createArticle` function uses a ternary expression to render a `Save to Favorites` button or a `Remove from Favorites` button depending on whether the article is already part of the user's favorites.

  - `loadPage` is a callback passed to the `createElement`. The actual function will either use the results from an AJAX request or the results from IndexedDb to render the page, depending on which function was passed through as a callback.

  - `createPlaceholders()` displays placeholders so that content is rendered on the page while the user waits for results from the AJAX request. Although they will only display on the page for a few seconds, they play a significant role in increasing the user's experience on the site.

- Open `topic.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  - When the `Topic` page is opened, `useIndexedDb` is called to check if any of the articles have been favorited. This is necessary so that articles that have already been saved to the user's favorites can display a `Remove from Favorites` button.

- Open `service-worker.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - Each html file should be cached with its respective bundle.

- Open `webpack.config.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  - There are 3 different entry points created for each app.

  - Each bundle will include all dependencies brought into each entry file with ES6 `import`.

- Although most of the configuration can vary, depending on the app, it's important that the icon `src` points to a valid path to an icon for the application.

- If time permits, ask the students if there are any parts of the application that they would like to spend more time going over.

  - Some students may be frustrated with the amount of time they needed to spend refactoring code so that it could be easily chunked by webpack.

  - If this is the case, remind students that one of the main motivations behind chunking is reducing the bundle size of your code. While there are many strategies one can take to split up their code, it is important that it's split in a way that makes the code reusable and clear in purpose. Sometimes this means large amounts of refactoring functions. This is time well spent since they are making their code easier to test and easier for other developers to work with.
