### Ins: Progressive Web Apps

- 630-40 (10 min)

- We will add a web app manifest and service worker to a gallery app to have a complete PWA with offline capabilities

- Explain PWA - sort of like an installable website. It is a generalization for websites that meet certain criteria around being able to perform like a native app. Once this criteria is met it is considered a PWA.

  - It is still built as a website but can be "installed" as an app that looks "native" (written for a specific platform)

  - Adds installation, push notifications, splash screen, offline

- Show [PWA checklist](https://web.dev/pwa-checklist/)

- Demo installing Google Maps PWA

- demo installing Pinterest on phone using "Your Phone"

- Demo installing the images app as a PWA

### Stu: 07-Stu_PWAs

- 640-55 (15 min)

### Ins: Review and 08-Ins_Manifest

- 7-10 (10 min)

- PWAs require a manifest, a service worker and the Cache API

- write one PWA to be delivered as website, desktop app, Android app and iOS app

- to setup our PWAs we need:

  - An app manifest (metadata about the site such as primary color and icon)

  - A service worker to handle the flow of installation, enable offline usage and support push notifications

  - Cache API

- Demo "Application" tab for https://secure-bayou-27137.herokuapp.com/

  - Cache Storage (cached assets)

  - Service Workers

    - Check "Offline" and reload (make sure network does not disable cache)

  - Manifest

- manifest - demo 08-Ins_Manifest

  - JSON

  - properties are called members

  - `short_name`: Optional for restrictive text locations such as an app launcher

  - `name`: Primary name to be displayed to user (installation for example)

  - `icons`: array of icons to be shown (launcher, task switcher, etc.)

  - `start_url`: when launched, where should it start

  - `display`: preferred mode (fullscreen, standalone, minimal-ui or browser)

  - `background_color`: placeholder background before stylesheet loads

  - `theme_color`: used for places like the chrome in the Android Chrome browser, can color various OS elements like Android's task switcher

- `manifest.webmanifest` is JSON file providing information for mobile and desktop installation

### Stu: 09-Stu_Manifest

- 710-25 (15 min)

### Ins: Review

- 725-35 (10 min)

- go through each member in the manifest

- show `index.html` which links it in

### Ins: 10-Ins_Service_Workers

- 735-45 (10 min)

- live code from the solved 9-manifest file (show it's actually mad about the missing service worker)

- `public/index.html`

- `public/service-worker.js`

  - the log does occur

### Stu: 11-Stu_Service_Workers

- 745-55 (10 min)

### Ins: Review

- 755-805 (10 min)

- `index.html`

- check if service workers are supported

- `register` the service worker to begin the lifecycle

  - show lifecycle image [overview](18-pwa\supplemental\service-workers.md)

- `service-worker.js` logs when the script is evaluated

- What step of the service worker lifecycle have we just completed?

- The registration step.

### BREAK

### Ins: 12-Ins_Caching_Fetching_Files

- 820-30 (10 min)

- in a service worker we are responsible for managing our cache

  - what should be cached

  - when should it be cached

  - when is it considered stale

  - when should it be evicted

- strategies for caching

  - eagerly - on install (pre-cache)

  - on-demand - open cache in response to user interaction such as clicking "read later"

  - lazily - on network response

- `service-worker.js`

  - `install`

    - called once when a new service worker is registered

    - `event.waitUntil` extends the lifetime of the `install` event, until the promise resolves

    - `caches.open` takes in a cache name and gives us back the opened cache which we can use to add our files. This is how we manage versioning as well.

    - `cache.addAll` accepts an array of URLs, retrieves them and updates the cache with the url as the key and the response as the value

    - `self.skipWaiting` will ensure any new versions of a service worker take over the page and activate immediately

      - if the page already had a service worker then refreshing would not load our new service worker by default

  - `activate`

    - evict outdated cache from previous service workers

    - `self.clients.claim` sets itself as the controller for all clients within its scope

  - `fetch`

    - intercepts network requests

    - `/api/` follows a network-first approach

      - after clicking "like" it will create the data cache

    - everything else follows offline-first

    - we must clone the `response` because it is a stream with a context that will die

    - store any responses we get back in the cache

- demo that the "api/posts" and imaage requests are served from the service worker in the network tab

- `loadPosts.js` (skip this part for time if needed)

  - creates some elements

  - `incrementLikes` - when a user likes a post we increment `data-likes`

  - `incrementLikesRequest` - makes an API call, then sets a status DOM element at the top of the page to let the user know whether of not their save was successful.

  - `updateLikesDisplay` - we indicate to the user whether or not their likes count is up to date by appending `(not saved)` to the like count for each post

  - demo offline and online like post message

- it's important to understand what this code does, not that you are able to write it

### Stu: 13-Stu_Caching_Fetching_Files

- 830-40 (10 min)

- cache files using service workers

### Ins: Review

- 840-45 (5 min)

- similar to the instructor demo

- show the updated Cache Storage

- Ask: What does a service worker do?

  - Acts as a proxy (intermediate step) when between a client making a request and browser sending the request to the network

### Ins: 14-Stu_Notetaker_PWA

- 845-50 (5 min)

- First let's make sure our app works as expected by adding a note normally.

- Next, we'll open up the Chrome Developer Tools and navigate to the `Service Worker` tab. Here, let's toggle the offline version and refresh the app.

  - Just like our other two apps, all of our resources have been cached and do not require a connection to access.

- go offline

### Stu: 14-Stu_Notetaker_PWA

- 850-920 (30 min)

- rate something first, this populates the cache

- demo the app

  - add a note

  - show service worker is installed

  - go offline and refresh

  - show network service worker hits

### Ins: Review

- 920-35 (15 min)

- `manifest.webmanifest`

  - Our manifest includes a name, `short_name`, several icons, and theme colors for our PWA

- `service-worker.js`

  - The only files we need to cache are `index.html`, `app.js`, and our favicon.

  - Our caches will be named `static-cache-v2` and `data-cache-v1` respectively.

- When install is triggered, we will add all of our specified files to the cache.

- The activate event fires when an old service worker is gone and the new one is installed. We use this listener to get rid of our old cache.

- Our `fetch` call has changed, since we are only fetching our cached static resources.
