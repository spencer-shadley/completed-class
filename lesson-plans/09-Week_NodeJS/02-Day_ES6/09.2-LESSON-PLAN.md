# 9.2 - Node and ES6 Day 2

## Drill

- Discuss mocha
- mention BDD (behavioral driven development)
- Live code with TDD the bonus

## Overview

In this class, we will be building on students' proficiency with Node by introducing them to additional ES6 features that they will be using in Node.

## Instructor Notes

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and implement how and when to use arrow functions
- Identify and implement how and when to use let and const variables
- Identify and destructuring of arrays, functions and objects in ES6
- Identify and implement how and when to use template literals
- Identify and apply for...of loops
- Identify and implement rest and spread syntax
- Identify and apply array methods forEach, filter and map

### Ins: 16-Ins_ArrowFunction

- 630-40 (10 min)

- Explain ES6 is an update to ECMAScript which is what JS is based on

  - QWERTY is a layout standard for keyboards
  - ECMA is a standard. JavaScript is written to comply to the ECMA standard with some additions.
  - JavaScript engines are created for each browser (V8 in Chrome and Node, SpiderMonkey in FF)

    - the engine knows how to actually perform the capabilities in the specification.
    - multiple engines may know how to "jump" but one may implement it more efficiently
    - JavaScript runtime is the system running the engine (in a browser there is a window object)

  - https://caniuse.com/#search=es6

    - Intl.PluralRules API (no safari)
    - WebXR Device API (only chrome)

  - demo arrow functions - write `01-syntax` by hand

- Now walk through the first part of the code in [02-context.js].

  - `setTimeout` changes the context in which it is being run. `this` stops referring to `person`

  - need to bind `this` using an arrow function

    - arrow functions automatically bind to the context or object it's created inside of even if it's not a property of that object

    - arrow functions inherit `this` from the context in which they're created

  - I help people a lot with this binding issue

  - we could resolve this issue by using `.bind(this)`

- [03-arrow-property-methods.js]

  - arrow functions bind to window scope in object declaration

  - generally use arrow functions with the exception of properties on an object

  - arrow functions are also missing `bind`, `call` and `apply` (methods on the Function proto)

### Stu: 17-Stu_ArrowFunctionPractice

- 640-50 (10 min)

- convert `function` syntax to arrows where applicable

### Ins: Review

- 650-55 (5 min)

- mention code golf

### Ins: 18-Ins_LetAndBlockScope

- 655-705 (10 min)

- introduce `let`

- ask: someone explain scope (specifically in a function)

- `let` and `const` are block scoped

- forces you to be clear and explicit about the expectation on how a variable will be used

- never use `var` again. Ever!

### Ins: 19-Ins_ConstantReference

- 705-15 (10 min)

- goes over `const`

- one additional change compared to `let` - the variable reference cannot be changed

- this helps prevent reassigning values we didn't mean to, expresses intent and self-documents the code

- each reference to a primitive type creates a new value to refer to in memory when modified

- ask: why is the last example not allowed?

- go back overview of:

  - `let` when a reference is going to be changed
  - `const` when it won't ever be changed

### Stu: 20-Stu_ConvertConstLetArrow

- 715-25 (10 min)

- Based on Crystal guessing game, convert to use ES6

- mention they don't need to understand the code

### Ins: Review

- 725-30 (5 min)

- ask why `let` and why `function` each time they appear

- if opened it's the same

### Ins: 21-Ins_FunctionalLoops

- 730-40 (10 min)

- introduces `forEach`, `filter` and `map`

### Stu: 22-Stu_FunctionalLoops

- 740-50 (10 min)

- try out `map` and `filter`

- bonus is to play code golf

### Ins: Review

- 750-55 (5 min)

- "When's a time in real life when you need to _filter_ through something?"

  - When shopping for pants, you're _filtering_ out all the ones on the rack that aren't your size.

  - When you're looking for your friend in a crowd, you're _filtering_ out everyone that doesn't look like them.

- "When's a time in real life when you need to _map_ over something?"

  - When you're _mapping_ through your todolist and marking off all the things you've completed for the day.

  - When you're _mapping_ through your laundry pile, categorizing your clothes so you can put them into the correct drawers.

- Explain that just like how we need to map and filter over things in real life, we often need to in code as well.

### BREAK

- 755-810 (15 min)

### Ins: 23-Ins_Template_Literals

- 810-15 (5 min)

- Template literals let you have multi-line strings with embedded code (interpolation) using the backtick

### Stu: 24-Stu_Template_Literals

- 815-25 (10 min)

- create an object and use template literals to create a nice HTML string

### Ins: Review

- 825-30 (5 min)

- We will keep practicing this

### Ins: 25-Ins_For_Of

- 830-35 (5 min)

- introduce for..of

- can be used for iterables such as strings, arrays, maps, sets and typedarrays

- `forEach` is limited to basically arrays

- `for in` has issues and is generally considered bad practice

### Stu: 26-Stu_For_Of

- 835-45 (10 min)

- loop through a list and add a class using `for...of`

### Ins: Review

- 845-50 (5 min)

- `for...of` is about 26% faster than `forEach`

### Ins: 27-Ins_Rest_and_Spread

- 850-55 (5 min)

- intro to spread and rest

- demo trying to add another argument after rest (it has to be the last one)

- fix the last spread operator (add `...dragons`)

### Stu: 28-Stu_Rest_and_Spread

- 855-905 (10 min)

- try out rest and spread building add function

### Ins: Review

- 905-10 (5 min)

### Ins: 29-Ins_ObjDestructuring

- 910-20 (10 min)

- object destructuring - pulls properties from an object into separate variables

- `const { name, parents } = arya;`

### Stu: 30-Stu_ObjDestructuring

- 920-30 (10 min)

- destructing practice across different object types

### Ins: Review

- 930-35 (5 min)

### Bonus! 31-bonus-fetch

- show `fetch()`
