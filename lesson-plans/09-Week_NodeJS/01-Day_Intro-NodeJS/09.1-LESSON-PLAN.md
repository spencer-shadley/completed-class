# 09.1 Lesson Plan: Introduction to Node.js

## Overview

This lesson introduces Node.js and the concepts of standard library, modules, npm, and package.json. Students will build an interactive command line application that outputs .json files using `fs` and `Inquirer`.

- Ensure that students have [downloaded and installed the LTS version of Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). The version number does not matter, just that it is the LTS version.

### Ins: Introduction to Node.js

- 630-40 (10 min)

  - Open the deck

### Ins: Node Check

- 640-45 (5 min)

- Everyone open a terminal

- We set this up day 1, let's make sure node still works

- type `node` followed by `1+1`

- then `ctrl+C`

### Ins: 01-Ins_Node-Demo

- 645-50 (5 min)

- use node to output in a terminal

- show how to change into directory and run node

  - then show shortcuts to open terminal where you are

- `node index.html`

- Ask: what will happen if I change it to `console.log(2+2)`?

### Students Do: 02-Stu_Hello-Node

- 650-55 (5 min)

- students do the same simple app

- bonus is figuring out how to debug - show how to run and debug in vs code (F5 is shortcut to debug)

### Ins: Review

- 655-7 (5 min)

- runtime environment is different than the browser (we are in a node environment)

  - nearly the same as browser but we do not have a "window" or ability to open a "prompt"

  - ask: what else do you think would be different?

### Ins: 03-Ins_process.argv

- 7-05 (5 min)

- demo of command arguments with `process.argv`

- debug and highlight `process.argv` (v = vector) (remember as values)

- arguments are:

  - path of installation to node
  - absolute path to file

- add the below and run `node index.js 4`:

```js
// arguments passed from the command line are accessed by index
console.log(process.argv[2]);
```

- Run:

  - `node index.js Hello`

  - `node index.js Hello World!`

  - `node index.js "Hello World!"`

- ask: why do we care?
  - dynamic and interactive applications (this is a CLI just like we had interfaces for the web)

### Students Do: 04-Stu_Parameter-Check

- 705-15 (10 min)

- compare if two command line inputs are equal

### Ins: Review

- 715-20 (5 min)

### Ins: 05-Ins_readFile

- 720-25 (5 min)

- uses `fs` (file system) to read a csv file

- import modules using `require` (ES5)

- installing node came with node's standard library with many modules

- to use a module you need to import it using `require`

  - this is like including a script tag in html

  - ask: why do we need to import it if it's in the standard library?
    - performance - only load what we need

- utf8 is the encoding we want to use

- edit `data.csv`

### Ins: 06-Ins_writeFile

- 725-30 (5 min)

- `fs.writeFile` to create and update files

- create a file

- update that file with different text

- read input from CLI `process.argv[2]`

- how can prevent it from overwriting?

### Students Do: 07-Stu_appendFile

- 730-40 (10 min)

- instead of writing a file allow appending to an existing file

### Ins: Review

- 740-45 (5 min)

- solution can be found with a quick google

### Ins: 08-Ins_Modularization

- 745-50 (5 min)

- example of how to export code with `module.exports`

- Node.js standard library modules are written in Javascript

- [Node.js source code for `fs`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/fs.js)

  - look at `appendFile`. Written in JavaScript using `fs.writeFile`

- Run `index.js` and point out that we did this using our own custom module from `badmath.js`

- This imports a dependency, exported from `badmath` via `module.exports`

### Students Do: 09-Stu_maths-Module

- 750-8 (10 min)

- add a math module export and use it

### BREAK

- 8-15 (15 min)

### Ins: Review

- 815-20 (5 min)

### Ins: 10-Ins_npm

- 820-30 (10 min)

  - How could we share modules as a community?

    - send each other code?

    - email? slack?

    - host on github and let people copy/paste?

    - what are the downsides?

      - not up-to-date

  - Go to https://npmjs.com

    - node package manager - command line utility and database of packages

    - point out the changing acronyms

    - search for anime

  - try running `index.js` and show the error

  - search npm for "badmath" https://www.npmjs.com/package/badmath

  - `npm install badmath`

  - show that this pulled it in to `node_modules`

  - and updated `package.json`

  - generated `package-lock.json`

    - The `package-lock.json` file is for keeping track of precise versions of all third-party libraries used in a project. This will be generated and updated for us automatically and we can ignore it for the most part.

  - `package.json` contains metdata about our module

### Stu: 11-Stu_package.json

- 830-35 (5 min)

- shows `npm install` on an existing `package.json`

### Instuctor Do: Review

- 835-40 (5 min)

### Ins: 12-Ins_npm-init

- 840-45 (5 min)

  - `npm init` (initialize)

  - `npm install --save <package-name>`

  - This is the same 'application' from earlier demo, importing `badmath` and logging two values.

  - ignore test commands for now - we'll learn about it later so leave it blank

  - git repository: https://github.com/nielsenjared/badmath

  - license: default is `ISC`, an open source, "as is" license.

  - If we want to learn more about ISC, we can read about it at the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC). We can specifiy any license we want. If we want to learn more about software licenses, we can review our options on the [GitHub Help page for Licensing a repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/licensing-a-repository)

  - npm parsed github and auto-generated several things

  - how would you add dependencies?

    - manually editing `package.json` or use `npm install badmath --save`

### Students Do: 13-Stu_npm-init

- 845-50 (5 min)

- students try `npm init`

### Ins: Review

- 850-55 (5 min)

  - `npm init -y` generates a `package.json` file with default values

    - Using the `-y`, or "yes", flag with `npm init` accepts all default options and leaves optional fields blank.

  - `npm install --save` installs a module as a dependency in our `package.json` file

  - `npm install --save-dev <package-name>` installs a module as a development dependency in our `package.json` file

  - `npm install -g <package-name>` installs a module globally

  - `npm uninstall` uninstalls a module. It can be combined with `-g`, `--save` and `--save-dev`.

* demo `npm init -y`

  - Why would we _not_ want to install our dependencies globally by default?

    - different projects may want different versions

  - What are examples of packages we _would_ want to install globally?

    - Developer tools that are not dependencies in our application code base.

* Run `npm install -g jshint` from the command line and explain the following:

  - We installed `jshint` globally using the `-g` flag, meaning we can use this package in any Node application.

  - How would we _uninstall_ a package?

  - We use the command `npm uninstall` with the package name and how we want to uninstall it, i.e: a dependency (`--save`), a dev dependency (`--save-dev`) or globally (`-g`).

* Run `npm uninstall -g jshint` from the command line and explain the following:

  - We uninstalled the `jshint` package globally using `npm uninstall -g`

### Ins: 14-Ins_Inquirer-Demo

- 855-9 (5 min)

  - The `inquirer.prompt` method accepts an array of objects, each with `type`, `name` and `message` properties.

  - The results of the `prompt` method are passed in an object as the callback parameter, `response`, in the Promise chain

- Ask the class:

  - What do we think this `inquirer` package does?

  - Based on the dictionary definition of _inquire_, it might be used to ask for information from someone, that someone being the user of our application.

- `npm install`

- `node index.js`

### Students Do: 15-Stu_Inquirer-Users

- 9-20 (20 min)

  - install before hand (don't show)

  - is a CLI of choices

  - After all prompts are entered, a `json` file is created from the name we entered at the prompt, for example: `spencer.json`

### Ins: Review

- 920-25 (5 min)

  - Our application requires two dependencies, one third-party (`inquirer`) the other standard library (`fs`).

  - We use two new `type` properties to prompt our user for a `"checkbox"` and a `"list"`, both of which require a `choices` property and a corresponding array of options.

  - We use the `JSON.stringify` optional `replacer` (`null`) and `space` (`\t`) parameters to format our `data` object with pretty-print appearance.

- Open [15-Stu_Inquirer-Users/index.js] in your IDE and explain the following:

  - Our application requires two dependencies, one third-party (`inquirer`) the other standard library (`fs`).

  - We use two new `type` properties to prompt our user for a `"checkbox"` and a `"list"`, both of which require a `choices` property and a corresponding array of options.

  - We pass the output of the `prompt` method to our Promise callback as `data`.

  - We named this parameter `response` in the demo, but we can call it anything, as long as it follows best-practices and is descriptive.

  - We create a `filename` variable by converting the value in `data.name` to lowercase, removing any spaces using `split(' ')` and then joining the split values back together without spaces using `.join('')`. We concatenate this value with `".json"` to add a file extension.

  - We use the `fs.writeFile` method to create a new file using our `filename` variable. We use the `JSON.stringify` optional `replacer` (`null`) and `space` (`\t`) parameters to format our `data` object with pretty-print appearance.
