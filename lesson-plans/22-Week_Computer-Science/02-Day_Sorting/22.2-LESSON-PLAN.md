# 22.2 - Sorting Algorithms

### Deck

- 630-7 (30 min)

- Complete the remainder of 21.1 deck

### Stu: Sorting By Hand

- 7-10 (10 min)

- raise your hand when you finished sorting by hand

- ask: how'd you sort them?

  - where did you start in the list?

  - what did you do with the first number?

  - how did you compare numbers?

  - what if there were 1,000 numbers?

### Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort

- 710-40 (30 min)

- I'm going to quickly go over five sorting algorithms

  - these are the easy ones to comprehend but you won't see any of them in practice

  - there are bonus activities for each of these if you'd like more in-depth examples

- `Bubble Sort`

  - it's horrible but very human-friendly

  - https://visualgo.net/en/sorting

  - if the adjacent number is larger, swap it until the end of the list

  - demo with deck of cards

  - each iteration sorts one item

  - ask: what's the complexity? (O(N^2))

  - probably the simplest sort out there, also infamously one of the worst - just showing for demo purposes

- `selection sort`

  - bonus-selection-sort if you want more info

  - find the smallest number

  - this is our first number

  - find the second smallest number

  - this is our second number

  - ...

  - demo with cards and then with https://visualgo.net/en/sorting

  - ask: Big O? O(N^2)

- `Insertion Sort`

  - https://visualgo.net/en/sorting

  - cards and then visualization

  - still O(N^2) average and worst

  - best case is now O(N) and is in-practice a bit faster

- `Monkey Sort` / `BOGO`

  - my favorite sort

  - shuffle the array randomly

  - if it's sorted, you're done. Otherwise re-shuffle.

- `Sleep Sort`

  - wait the amount of time of value in the array and then insert that into the new array

- ask: which of these is best?

  - they're all terrible

- ask: does anyone know of better sorting algorithms?

  - mergesort, quicksort, heapsort

### BREAK

- 740-55 (15 min)

### Ins: Quick-Sort

- 755-815 (20 min)

- this is a much harder sort to comprehend

- the others were intuitive and, as a result, tend to have simple code

- we can trade code complexity for performance

- created because insertion sort was too slow

  - `Array.sort` will sometimes use QuickSort and sometimes use MergeSort (depending on data)

  - Mozilla uses MergeSort and Chromium uses a mix of insertion sort and quick sort

    - WebKit numeric arrays use std::qsort (quick sort)

    - contiguous non-numeric arrays use mergesort

    - the non-contiguous arrays use selection sort or an AVL tree

- algorithm - all about pivots

  - pick a random pivot (location doesn't matter)

  - remove pivot from array (swap with ending element)

  - find the first item from the left that is larger than pivot

  - find the first item from the right that is smaller than pivot

  - repeat until index of the item from the left is greater than the index of the item from the right

  - swap itemFromLeft with pivot

  - all items to the left of pivot are smaller

  - all items to the right of pivot are larger

  - recurse

- show https://visualgo.net/en/sorting

### Stu: 2-quick-sort

- 815-35 (20 min)

- pseudocode quick sort

### Ins: Review

- 835-50 (15 min)

- Go over pseudo-code

- Go over in place solution

- Mention another example that is not in-place

- Remember this is still O(N^2) but that is very rarely true, tends to actually perform at O(NlogN)

### Ins: MergeSort

- 850-920 (30 min)

- one of the most common algorithms in computing

- one of, if not the, most popular sort

- quick sort is also very popular

- FireFox uses MergeSort - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224128

- already talked about in a pre-class drill

- this is a "divide and conquer" problem

  - we've solved lots of these

  - break the problem into small pieces and solve the small piece

- this is recursive

  1. base case is a single element
  1. recurse on two halves

- split the input into two halves until you can't split them anymore (logN)

  - https://personalzone-hulgokm2zfcmm9u.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/merge-sort-algorithm-tutorial-divide-visualization.jpg

- combine the split arrays

  - https://personalzone-hulgokm2zfcmm9u.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/merge-sort-algorithm-tutorial-conquer-1.jpg

  - we need to figure out how to combine them, may need

- https://visualgo.net/en/sorting

- Merge sort is a stable sort. In another words, if two values are equal, the relative order prior to sorting will be maintained.
- The worst case time complexity of Merge sort is O (n log n).
- The space complexity of merge sort is O (n).
- Merge sort scales well with large amounts of data.
- Merge sort scales horizontally - a k-way mergesort enables splitting this work across different machines

### Ins: Closing

- 920-30 (10 min)

- https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms

  - Different sorts can make since in different applications

  - sorts finish early for different types of input

- You will likely not need to implement these sorts in your job, somebody already implemented them better than you probably can

  - they may come up in interviews though

  - also an example of how to think algorithimically

- it took me a lot of examples to really understand each sort

- try going through different examples with these sorts, lots of resources available to help
