# 22.1 - Basics of Algorithms

# Drill

This is a variation of Kadane's algorithm.

Kadane's algorithm enables finding the maxiumum contiguous subarray sum.

Subarray just means a smaller piece of the array and being contiguous means all chosen elements
must be adjacent (not broken apart.)

Draw the example and highlight (underline) each potential contiguous sub-array

What are all the possible sub-arrays O(N^2)

- brute force, start here and tell your interviewer that's what you're thinking

- explore all windows to the end (keep expanding the window you're considering)

- draw out sum of each sub-array

  - first element is just the element

  - add the next element, update the max

  - add the next next element, update the max

  - cubic solution goes all the way back to the beginning and recompute the entire sum

  - lots of redundancy

    - from cracking the code interview, optimize for (Bottlenecks, unnecessary work or duplicate work) BUD

- this can be improved to O(N^2) by referencing the previous sum and just adding the new element to it (removing the innermost loop)

- DP is about finding the sub-problems and how they relate to the overall problem

- start subarray with just one element

  - if my end was at this index, what would my max contiguous sub-array be?

  - draw beginning to that point, index 1 to that point, etc.

  - consider ending at each of the indices

  - what choices do we have at each element

    - we can start a new subarray

      - best subarray ending there is just itself

    - continue the max subarray by adding the current item

  - understand the previous sub-problem to understand the current sub-problem

- visualize with an array, even though we don't actually need one

# HW Architecture

- this is our example of integrating the entire react stack

  - mongoose to store the favorites

  - express to start a server

  - react for the front-end

  - node as the runtime environment

- divide into a `client` and server code

  - `create-react-app` can bootstrap the `client` part

  - `package.json`

    ```js
    "proxy": "http://localhost:3001/",
    ```

  - this is so we can still use live reloading with a second server while developing. In production it will use bundled webpack generated code from your build directory (demo `npm run build`)

- server part needs (steal from `21-MERN/01-Activities/05-Stu_ReactRouter`):

  - `package.json`

    ```js
    "scripts": {
      "start": "if-env NODE_ENV=production && npm run start:prod || npm run start:dev",
      "start:prod": "node server.js",
      "start:dev": "concurrently \"nodemon --ignore 'client/*'\" \"npm run client\"",
      "client": "cd client && npm run start",
      "install": "cd client && npm install",
      "build": "cd client && npm run build",
      "heroku-postbuild": "npm run build"
    },
    ```

  - `server.js`

    ```js
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === `production`) {
      app.use(express.static(`client/build`));
    }
    ```

- Google Books API

  - the client still makes an API request to the backend

  - the backend then makes a call to Google Books API using `axios` with a little bit of filtering logic since some data is missing on the results and filters out unsaved books

- don't forget our organization techniques

  - server directories

    - controllers, models, routes (api and index)

  - client directories

    - public, src

      - components, pages (Home, 404, saved), utils (API)

## Ins: Welcome

- 630-35

- welcome back!

- this week will be focused entirely on computer science. This is by far the most important week in the course. It will help you get a job and changes the way you think about problems

- I added reviews for each topic in `resources/reviews`

- there's a lot to cover so I want to jump into it

### Stu: 1-binary-search

- 635-55 (20 min)

- review binary search by going through the examples and https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html (5 min)

- we cut our search space in half every time

  - https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*j8fUQjaUlmrQEN_udU0_TQ.jpeg

- Implement binary search (pseudocode first)

- Imagine that this was gigantic, an entire dictionary

- research binary search, there is a link to the visualization that helped me understand binary search when I learned it in college

### Ins: Review

- 655-715 (20 min)

- go over the code

- benchmark (show how doubling changes perf)

  - https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*j8fUQjaUlmrQEN_udU0_TQ.jpeg

- when is this not efficient? (if you have to sort it)

  - we could store that sorted input somewhere, or mandate it comes to us sorted. This "amortizes" the one-time cost of sorting which can be worth it if we have many searches.

- ask: what is the name for an algorithm that takes twice as long if you double its input? (linear)

- is binary search faster than linear?

- ask: why is binary search so much faster?

  - think about the "remainder problem" as we search

  - with each iteration we remove one element with a linear search

  - with each iteration we remove half of the elements in a binary search (this grows with input size)

- ask: what is the name we use to describe these types of times? (Big O)

- I used binary sort to find a culprit slide that refused to let me save my fonts

### 2-ins-hash

- 720-50 (30 min)

- log(N) is fast but is there a faster complexity?

  - constant time O(1) - doesn't matter how large the input is, you can find an element immediately

- ask: what is the access time for an array?

  - so the expensive part is finding the right index to use

- one idea is to "hash" the key to find an index

  - "a" > 0, "b" > 1, etc.

  - `letterCountsHashArray.js`

- A "data structure" is something that can hold data

  - there are lots of ways to do it

  - arrays and objects are two of them - there are many more

- A map is a data structure which stores key/value pairs. It is the most popular tool in your interviewing toolbelt and one of the few data structures you will actually use in industry.

- An object is a hacky map (has limited support but can do a lot of the operations)

  - historically these have been used as make-shift HashMaps

  - `letterCountsObject.js`

- A `Map` is the real JavaScript way (new in ES6) to create a Map

- About Map

  - in general a "map" is a data structure which supports key/value pairs (given a key, here is the corresponding value)

- About HashMap

  - https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*wHiuDrmhLsyJbgGWCEBBcQ.png

  - Starts with an initial capacity

  - resized once the "load factor" is exceeded (this is expensive but is amortized constant) load factor is generally ~75%

- Object in JavaScript lets us set key/value pairs and have historically been used as HashMaps

- `objectVsMap.js`

### Stu: 3-stu-map

- 750-820 (30 min)

- solve a leetcode problem on this, written in interview format

### Ins: Review

- 820-30 (10 min)

### Stu: 4-stu-map

- 830-9 (30 min)

- another leetcode problem

### Ins: review

- 9-10 (10 min)

### Ins: Big O

- 910-30 (25 min)

- go through as much of the slidedeck as possible

- https://cooervo.github.io/Algorithms-DataStructures-BigONotation/index.html

bring a deck of cards to class tomorrow (sorting)

## Bonus Lecture - bonus-lodash

- Lodash, a utility library

  - helper to make it easy to do common actions

  - probably will make project 3 easier

- the most downloaded npm module (https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended)

  - React is number 2 at a little less than half

- live code each example in `lodashExamples.js`

- tell: I added a README with a practice problem if you'd like
