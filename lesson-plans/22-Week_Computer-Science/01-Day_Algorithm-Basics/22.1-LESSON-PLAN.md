# 22.1 - Basics of Algorithms

## Ins: Welcome

- 630-35

- welcome back!

- this week will be focused entirely on computer science. This is by far the most important week in the course. It will help you get a job and changes the way you think about problems

- ask: last time we showed [linear search](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html)

  - Did you find a better way to search?

### Stu: 1-binary-search

- 635-55 (20 min)

- Ask: how can we find an animal in the below list?

- Imagine that this was gigantic, an entire dictionary

- research binary search, there is a link to the visualization that helped me understand binary search when I learned it in college

### Ins: Binary Search Revealed

- 655-720 (25 min)

- how can we search in our example faster?

- `example.md`

  ```
  Angora Rabbit
  Axolotl
  Bearded Vulture
  Blobfish
  Fossa
  Glaucus Atlanticus
  Goblin Shark
  Japanese Spider Crab
  Leaf Deer
  Liger
  Maned Wolf
  Narwhal
  Okapi
  Pacu Fish
  Pink Fairy Armadillo
  Red Panda
  Slow Loris
  ```

- show https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html

- if the input is sorted, we can easily remove half of our search-space on every iteration

- when is this not efficient? (if you have to sort it)

  - we could store that sorted input somewhere, or mandate it comes to us sorted. This "amortizes" the one-time cost of sorting which can be worth it if we have many searches.

- how long will it take if I double the array size?

  - O(logN)

- ask: what is the name for an algorithm that takes twice as long if you double its input? (linear)

- is binary search faster than linear?

- ask: why is binary search so much faster?

  - think about the "remainder problem" as we search

  - with each iteration we remove one element with a linear search

  - with each iteration we remove half of the elements in a binary search (this grows with input size)

- ask: what is the name we use to describe these types of times? (Big O)

### 2-ins-hash

- 720-50 (30 min)

- log(N) is fast but is there a faster complexity?

  - constant time O(1) - doesn't matter how large the input is, you can find an element immediately

- ask: what is the access time for an array?

  - so the expensive part is finding the right index to use

- one idea is to "hash" the key to find an index

  - "a" > 0, "b" > 1, etc.

  - `letterCountsHashArray.js`

- A "data structure" is something that can hold data

  - there are lots of ways to do it

  - arrays and objects are two of them - there are many more

- A map is a data structure which stores key/value pairs. It is the most popular tool in your interviewing toolbelt and one of the few data structures you will actually use in industry.

- An object is a hacky map (has limited support but can do a lot of the operations)

  - historically these have been used as make-shift HashMaps

  - `letterCountsObject.js`

- A `Map` is the real JavaScript way (new in ES6) to create a Map

- About Map

  - in general a "map" is a data structure which supports key/value pairs (given a key, here is the corresponding value)

- About HashMap

  - https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*wHiuDrmhLsyJbgGWCEBBcQ.png

  - Starts with an initial capacity

  - resized once the "load factor" is exceeded (this is expensive but is amortized constant) load factor is generally ~75%

- Object in JavaScript lets us set key/value pairs and have historically been used as HashMaps

- `objectVsMap.js`

### Stu: 3-stu-map

- 750-820 (30 min)

- solve a leetcode problem on this, written in interview format

### Ins: Review

- 820-30 (10 min)

### Stu: 4-stu-map

- 830-9 (30 min)

- another leetcode problem

### Ins: review

- 9-10 (10 min)

### Ins: Big O

- 910-30 (20 min)

- go through as much of the slidedeck as possible
