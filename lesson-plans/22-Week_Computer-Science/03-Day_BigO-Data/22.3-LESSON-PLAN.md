# 22.3 - Graphs

### Ins: Welcome

- 10-05 (5 min)

- today we are going to learn about trees, binary trees, binary search trees, graphs, depth-first-search and breadth-first-search

### Ins: Define Trees

- 1005-20 (15 min)

- draw DOM tree - ask what data structure it is

- draw git branches tree

- explain terminology

  - root node

  - child node

  - edge

  - leaf node

  - value stored in the node (otherwise it's pretty useless)

  - level (root is at level 1)

  - binary (at most two-children)

  - n-ary (no upper limit on children)

- ask: how can we represent this in code?

  - we need a node class

- ask: what would that node class contain?

  - references to other nodes

  - a value

### Stu: 1-trees

- 1020-25 (25 min)

- draw, pseudocode, create the class and then traverse a tree class

### Ins: Review

- 1025-40 (15 min)

- create the binary tree class

- use it to create the tree

- traverse it

- do the same for n-ary

- lots of tree problems, included leetcode link

### Ins: Binary Search Trees

- 1040-55 (15 min)

- https://visualgo.net/en/bst

- a special type of binary tree with extra rules applied

  - all values in the left subtree must be less than the value of the current node

  - all values in the right subtree must be greater than the value of the current node

- ask: how many steps would it take to find a value in the tree? What is the Big O?

  - O(N)

- ask: what about insertion? O(N)

- ask: what about deletion? O(N)

- ask: if it's so slow why do we care?

- ask: what if we made it also "balanced", leaf nodes may not differ by more than one level

  - Red-Black Tree logN for everything now

### Stu: 2-binary-search-tree

- 1055-1125 (30 min)

### Ins: Review

- 1125-45 (20 min)

- bonus leetcode problem is included

### BREAK

- 1145-1215 (30 min)

### Ins: Intro Graphs

- 1215-35 (20 min)

- another data structure

- a tree is actually a graph

- it is a directed acyclic graph

- show that the tree is actually directed

- explain a cycle

- show graph of map of cities with airports

  - DFW

  - Austin

  - SeaTac

- graph may be social network

- network nodes

- terminology

  - node/vertex

  - edge/arc

  - weight/cost

  - directed vs undirected

  - adjacency (is there an edge between two nodes)

- with graphs we often have a cost associated with the edges

  - traveling from DFW to Austin is not the same as DFW to London Heathrow or Tokyo

- we put a cost on each edge

- commonly we want to go from point a to point b with a minimal cost

- example: GPS solves this problem all the time

  - time cost between different roads

- draw a graph of airports

### Stu: 3-graphs

- 1235-55 (20 min)

- Implement the `addNode` and `addEdge` functions to the graph

### Ins: Review

- 1255-110 (15 min)

- implement the functions live

- show how the example maps to the picture

- ask: how could we search in this graph for a value?

### Ins: 4-dfs

- 110-25 (15 min)

- there are two main concepts for searching graphs

- DFS will consider all nodes by "charging forward"

  - it picks a path and keeps going

  - eventually it hits a blocker and "backtracks"

- it needs to "remember" what nodes it has visited during this process

- draw this based on the existing graph example

- show algorithm

- walk through it

- ask: what would happen if we started at C?

### Stu: 5-dfs-sum

- 125-35 (10 min)

- find the number of connected nodes (bonus is the weight)

- a very small activity, mostly just read through the code and understand what it's doing

- dfs-queen problem

### Ins: Review

- 135-40 (5 min)

- quickly show the couple of line changes

### Ins: 6-bfs

- 140-50 (10 min)

- the difference between dfs and bfs is the order in which nodes are considered

- instead of doing a "charge forward" (depth) approach, spread out slowly

- ask: instead of a stack we will want to use a... (queue)

- there is no queue in javascript natively so I made one

- there is no LinkedList in javascript natively so I made one

- after that it's just a few small line changes to switch from stack to queue

- live code the changes (copy/paste dfs)

  - stack > queue

### Dijkstra, Prim, A\*

- 150-55 (5 min)

- Now that we know the concepts behind searching you can start optimizing for certain behaviors

- Shortest Path Algorithms

  - Dijkstra is the most famous, minimizes the cost to get from a node to another node using BFS with a priority queue

  - also Prim and A\*

### Ins: Close

- 155-2 (5 min)

- look into shortest path algorithms

- try out the extra big o activity

- try out the extra data structures activity

- practice graph and search problems in leetcode

  - added one called `dfs-queen.js`

- there are a ton of resources for preparing for interviews

  - show resources

  - go through as many as possible (mind map is a good start)

  - will go through resources at the beginning of Tuesday's class for those interested

- There are a lot of bonus activities from today if you'd like more information and/or more practice
