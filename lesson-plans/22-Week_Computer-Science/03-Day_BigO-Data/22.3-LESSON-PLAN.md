# 22.3 - Graphs

### Ins: Welcome

- 10-05 (5 min)

- today we are going to learn about trees, binary trees, binary search trees, graphs, depth-first-search and breadth-first-search

### Trees

- talk about DOM tree

- draw DOM - ask what data structure it is

- explain terminology

  - root node

  - child node

  - edge

  - leaf node

  - value stored in the node (otherwise it's pretty useless)

  - level

- ask: how can we represent this in code?

  - we need a node class

- ask: what would that node class contain?

  - references to other nodes

  - a value

- activity: pseudocode a tree class

### Binary Trees

- a special type of tree

- each node contains at most two children

### Binary Search Trees

- https://visualgo.net/en/bst

- a special type of binary tree with extra rules applied

- talk about Big O

- ask for the Big O of a regular tree and a binary tree (search, insert, remove)

### BREAK

- (40 min)

### Graphs

- a tree is actually a graph

- it is a directed acyclic graph

- show graph of map of cities with airports

  - DFW

  - Austin

  - SeaTac

- with graphs we often have a cost associated with the edges

  - traveling from DFW to Austin is not the same as DFW to London Heathrow or Tokyo

- we put a cost on each edge

- commonly we want to go from point a to point b with a minimal cost

- example: GPS solves this problem all the time

  - time cost between different roads

### Depth-First-Search

- dfs-queen problem

### Breadth-First-Search

### Ins: Close

- There are a lot of bonus activities if you'd like more information and/or more practice
