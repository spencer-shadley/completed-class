# 22.3 - Graphs

### Ins: Welcome

- 10-05 (5 min)

- today we are going to learn about trees, binary trees, binary search trees, graphs, depth-first-search and breadth-first-search

### Ins: Define Trees

- 1005-20 (15 min)

- draw DOM tree - ask what data structure it is

- draw git branches tree

- explain terminology

  - root node

  - child node

  - edge

  - leaf node

  - value stored in the node (otherwise it's pretty useless)

  - level (root is at level 1)

  - binary (at most two-children)

  - n-ary (no upper limit on children)

- ask: how can we represent this in code?

  - we need a node class

- ask: what would that node class contain?

  - references to other nodes

  - a value

### Stu: 1-trees

- 1020-25 (25 min)

- draw, pseudocode, create the class and then traverse a tree class

### Ins: Review

- 1025-40 (15 min)

- create the binary tree class

- use it to create the tree

- traverse it

- do the same for n-ary

- lots of tree problems, included leetcode link

### Ins: Binary Search Trees

- 1040-55 (15 min)

- https://visualgo.net/en/bst

- a special type of binary tree with extra rules applied

  - all values in the left subtree must be less than the value of the current node

  - all values in the right subtree must be greater than the value of the current node

- ask: how many steps would it take to find a value in the tree? What is the Big O?

  - O(N)

- ask: what about insertion? O(N)

- ask: what about deletion? O(N)

- ask: if it's so slow why do we care?

- ask: what if we made it also "balanced", leaf nodes may not differ by more than one level

  - Red-Black Tree logN for everything now

### Stu: 2-binary-search-tree

- 1055-1125 (30 min)

### Ins: Review

- 1125-45 (20 min)

- bonus leetcode problem is included

### BREAK

- 1145-1215 (30 min)

### Ins: Intro Graphs

- 1215-35 (20 min)

- another data structure

- a tree is actually a graph

- it is a directed acyclic graph

- show that the tree is actually directed

- explain a cycle

- show graph of map of cities with airports

  - DFW

  - Austin

  - SeaTac

- graph may be social network

- network nodes

- terminology

  - node/vertex

  - edge/arc

  - weight/cost

  - directed vs undirected

  - adjacency (is there an edge between two nodes)

- with graphs we often have a cost associated with the edges

  - traveling from DFW to Austin is not the same as DFW to London Heathrow or Tokyo

- we put a cost on each edge

- commonly we want to go from point a to point b with a minimal cost

- example: GPS solves this problem all the time

  - time cost between different roads

- draw a graph of airports

### Stu: 3-graphs

- 1235-55 (20 min)

- Implement the `addNode` and `addEdge` functions to the graph

### Ins: Review

- 1255-110 (15 min)

- implement the functions live

- show how the example maps to the picture

- ask: how could we search in this graph for a value?

### Ins: Depth-First-Search

- 110-40 (30 min)

- explain the idea

- dfs-queen problem

### Breadth-First-Search

- 140-155 (15 min)

- explain the idea

- example problem?

### Ins: Close

- 155-2 (5 min)

- show resources

- There are a lot of bonus activities if you'd like more information and/or more practice
