- https vs http

  - two different protocols
  - hypertext transfer protocol
  - s stands for secure
  - https uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt requests and responses
    - public key encryption - public and private keys
    - public key is shared via the SSL certificate
      - demo valid SSL certificate
      - demo invalid SSL certificate
    - this authenticates the person is who they say they are
      - prevents man in the middle attacks
    - An independent authority verifies the identity of the certificate owner. So each SSL Certificate contains unique, authenticated information about the certificate owner.
