# 08.3 - Project Presentations #1 (10:00 AM)

## Overview

Students present their projects to their peers.

- Project presentations are a rare opportunity for students to practice speaking on technical topics in front of an audience of peers.

- Limit presentations to 10 minutes: 7 or 8 for the presentation itself followed by 2 or 3 minutes for Q & A. This will ensure that every group presents and allow padding for transitions between groups.

  - What unexpected challenges did you experience?
  - What would you change if you could go back?
  - What future features would you want to add?
  - What was your biggest learning moment?
  - Are you, or anyone you know, going to use this app?
  - Which technology was your favorite?
  - How would you describe your experience with the entire Git process? (Creating branches, Merging to Master, Managing Pull Requests)

- Prior to class, and during presentations if necessary, collaborate with your TAs to prepare a slide deck of superlative "awards" for groups. Refer to [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing).
