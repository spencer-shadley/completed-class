# 10.2 Lesson Plan: Test-Driven-Development

## Overview

Today's class introduces students to test-driven-development and unit testing JavaScript applications.

GitHub CI example: https://github.com/spencer-shadley/example-jest-ci/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Node+CI%22

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the benefits of test-driven-development

- Use unit tests before as a way to define code requirements for code that hasn't been written yet

- Write unit tests for pre-existing JavaScript functions

- Use mocks to test side effects such as reading/writing to the file system, printing to the console, and AJAX requests

- Use the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern to structure test code

### Instructor Do: Introduce Testing

- 630-40 (10 min)

  - How do you know if your code is working?

  - What if you change something? Do you re-check the entire application every time?

  - We can automate with tests and provide guarantees that code doesn't break anything

  - Tests also force better more readable code and really think about how your code will be consumed

  - This is not specific to web applications. Any software should have tests.

  - About 1/3rd of engineers at Tableau only write tests. If you enjoy this it could be a career path.

    - Test engineer can also used as a first step towards a developer role

  - Adding tests is a common first task at a company

### Students Do: TDD Research

- 640-50 (10 min)

- Work in pairs researching test driven development and its benefits

### Instructor Do: Review

- 650-55 (5 min)

  - What is test-driven-development?

  - Why is it helpful to write tests before writing application code?

    - Forces a clean API
    - Forces more comprehensive thought process to have been considered
    - Modular code, break it up into its pieces
      - Clear responsibilities divided across different files, functions or modules
      - Cohesive code - Colocated code has related functionality. It's not entangled or dependent on other parts of the codebase
    - Enables quickly making sure that any code you are working on is correct, slowly building up to to pass the tests
    - This also provides self-documenting usage examples. It's somewhat common to understand how something should work by first reading its unit tests

  - What are some drawbacks of TDD?

    - Might take longer
    - Might be difficult to write tests for problems we're uncertain of

  - It's a red flag when interviewing someone and they don't use TDD

### Students Do: 08-Stu_TDD-Dissect

- 655-705 (10 min)

### Instructor Do: Review

- 705-10 (5 min)

- We are using a module called `Jest` to write unit tests

- We've had a sneak peek in our pre-class drills using mocha at TDD

- `Jest` is similar and also follows BDD (Behavioral Driven Development)

  - The expected behavior, or functionality, is described and tested for

  - `describe` starts a test suite of related tests

  - `it` specifies an individual unit test - it should be focused on a specific behavior for a given unit of code

    - this is human readable - your grandmother should be able to understand what's it's testing for

  - `expect` asserts validation and will throw an error when it does not meet the validation (failing the test)

    - show https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect

- Tests follow the AAA pattern - Arrange, Act, Assert

- We can run the tests with `npm run test`

  - This is a script we added inside `package.json`

    - Show just running `jest` (might need to do a global install)

    - Add `list-files` script with `ls`

  - This looks inside `test` for any files ending with `.test.js`

  - Fail a test

- Demo the other files

  - default parameters with `= value`

  - We can chain values because each function returns an arithmetic (show `index.js`)

### Students Do: 09-Stu_TDD

- 710-25 (15 min)

- write tests for three unimplemented functions

### Instructor Do: Review

- 725-30 (5 min)

- Can your grandma understand these tests?

- Do you think these are good tests?

  - Yes, if they fail, it means the code isn't doing what it should.

- Do you think these are _enough_ tests?

  - No, it doesn't account for things like empty strings, what should happen if given invalid arguments or edge cases like palindromes with different casing or spaces.

### Students Do: 10-Stu_Pass-Tests

- 730-40 (10 min)

- Implement the functions to get the tests to pass

### Instructor Do: Review

- 740-45 (5 min)

  - Writing tests before writing code helps us ensure that our code will work.

  - Writing tests first allows for more rapid development because we will not have to manually test our code.

  - Live code, three simple functions - show tests slowly passing

### Instructor Do: 11-Ins_Organizing-Tests

- 745-50 (5 min)

- Example of using Arrange, Act, Assert

- Positive, negative and exception tests

- In each, you can consider the average user, monkey and devil

- Show two source files

- Start with todoList tests (has positive, negative and exceptions)

### Students Do: 12-Stu_Structured-Tests

- 750-805 (15 min)

- test two constructors using AAA

### Instructor Do: Review

- 805-15 (10 min)

- check for exceptions using `toThrow` or `toThrowError` matchers

- why would we throw an error?

  - makes debugging what went wrong easier and we can code assuming axioms after checks

### BREAK

- 815-30 (15 min)

### Instructor Do: 13-Ins_Introduce-Mocks

- 830-40 (10 min)

- Use mocks for `console.log` example

- Start with demo of `index.js`

- then `logger.js`

  - this is called the "dynamic prototype pattern"

- Explain the black test (and only the black test)

  - Mocks can "spy" on functions to see if they are being called, prevent undesired side effects (writing a file) or unpredictable behavior (AJAX calls) or to limit how much our unit test covers

- Lots of shared code, beforeEach and afterEach

### Students Do: 14-Stu_First-Mock

- 840-855 (15 min)

- add spies to mock the `console.log` method from the daycare example

### Instructor Do: Review

- 855-905 (10 min)

### Instructor Do: 15-Ins_Module-Mock-Demo

- 905-10 (5 min)

- mock `axios` for getting movies

- There are a few extra steps required to mock third party and built-in node modules, but the idea is the same.

- We require axios and mock it, since we want to prevent actual AJAX requests from happening. This is one way of mocking a node module.

- We mock the return value of `axios.get` to be a new Promise object that resolves to an object that contains a `data` property that's set to an empty object. We're mocking the return value to this because it's similar to what we would get from the response from the OMDB API.

### Students Do: 16-Stu_Mock-Fs

- 910-20 (10 min)

- mock the `fs` module

### Instructor Do: Review

- 920-25 (5 min)

- mocking the fs module prevents slow tests, minimizes the surface area of what could break and avoids side effects for the next tests

### Bonus
