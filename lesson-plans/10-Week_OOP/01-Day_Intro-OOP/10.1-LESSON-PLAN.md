# 10.1 - Hard Hat Zone: Constructors at Work (6:30 PM)

## Overview

In this class we will be introducing students to the usage of JavaScript constructors and how they can be used to dynamically create objects with similar schemas.

### Ins: Slide deck

- 630-35 (10 min)

### Students Do: 01-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs

- 635-50 (10 min)

- object refresher - raining cats and dogs

### Ins: Review

- 650-55 (5 min)

### Ins: 02-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors

- 655-705 (10 min)

- what do you see which is different from the previous activity?

  - constructor function is capitalized and can take in parameters

  - the `new` keyword creates an instance of that `class` (new to ES6)

  - we don't have an explicit `return` in the function - `new` handles this

  - noun = object, generalized = class

  - verb = function

  - verb performed by a noun = method

    - a dog barks -> dog = noun/object; bark = verb/method

    - common properties between instances/nouns = class (animal)

- show how to make named parameters

  ```js
  function Animal2({ raining, noise }) {
    this.raining = raining;
    this.noise = noise;
    this.makeNoise = () => {
      console.log(this.noise);
    };
  }
  const cow = new Animal2({ raining: true, noise: 'moo' });
  cow.makeNoise();
  ```

- Constructors enable greater flexibility. We can share similar code from a single blueprint.

### Stu: 03-Stu_Mini-Bank

- 705-25 (20 min)

### Ins: Review

- 725-35 (10 min)

### Stu: 04-Stu_Weather-Admin

- 735-50 (15 min)

- each time a user searches it creates a log

- each time an admin uses it they see the logs

- broken, need to fix several things

### Ins: Review

- 750-8 (10 min)

- entry point is `CLI.js`

- added comments on code that was changed/fixed

### BREAK

- 8-15 (15 min)

### Ins: 05-Ins_Prototypes

- 815-30 (15 min)

  - Objects, arrays, and primitives all have a `.prototype.`

  - The `.prototype.` has methods and properties attached to it.

  - Methods declared on the prototype are declared once and memory is allocated for them once, but all objects made from it have access.

  - Instance methods only exist on a particular instance of an object, prototype methods are on all instances.

- debug the code in node, advancing section by section

- `.__proto__`

- `__proto__` is on instances

- `prototype` is on classes and is used to create `__proto__` on instances using `new`

- the `Movie` inherits the `prototype` from the `Object` class which includes things like `toString` and `hasOwnProperty`

- because of this protypical inheritance we can share the same methods (logInfo) across all instances while still having their own unique properties (name, release year)

### Stu: 06-Stu_RPG-Prototypes

- 830-50 (20 min)

- create an RPG character

### Ins: Review

- 850-9 (10 min)

- Why don't we just declare the methods in the constructor?

- When we bind a function using the `this` keyword, the method only exists on that instance of the object. For any method bound to `this`, it will be re declared with each new instance of an object.

- How does the prototype help us solve this problem?

- The prototype allows us to declare methods that will be attached to all instances of an object of that prototype. Because the method is applied to the prototype, it is only stored in memory once for all instances.
