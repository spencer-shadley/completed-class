# 10.1 - Hard Hat Zone: Constructors at Work (6:30 PM)

## Overview

In this class we will be introducing students to the usage of JavaScript constructors and how they can be used to dynamically create objects with similar schemas.

### Instructor Do: Slide deck

- 630-35 (10 min)

### Students Do: 01-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs

- 635-50 (10 min)

- object refresher - raining cats and dogs

### Instructor Do: Review

- 650-55 (5 min)

### Instructor Do: 02-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors

- 655-705 (10 min)

- what do you see which is different from the previous activity?

  - constructor function is capitalized and can take in parameters

  - the `new` keyword creates an instance of that `class` (new to ES6)

  - we don't have an explicit `return` in the function - `new` handles this

  - noun = object, generalized = class

  - verb = function

  - verb performed by a noun = method

    - a dog barks -> dog = noun/object; bark = verb/method

    - common properties between instances/nouns = class (animal)

- show how to make named parameters

  ```js
  function Animal2({ raining, noise }) {
    this.raining = raining;
    this.noise = noise;
    this.makeNoise = () => {
      console.log(this.noise);
    };
  }
  const cow = new Animal2({ raining: true, noise: 'moo' });
  cow.makeNoise();
  ```

- Constructors enable greater flexibility. We can share similar code from a single blueprint.

### Student Do: 03-Stu_Mini-Bank

- 705-25 (20 min)

### Instructor Do: Review

- 725-35 (10 min)

### Student Do: 04-Stu_Weather-Admin

- 735-50 (15 min)

- each time a user searches it creates a log

- each time an admin uses it they see the logs

- broken, need to fix several things

### Instructor Do: Review

- 750-8 (10 min)

- entry point is `CLI.js`

- added comments on code that was changed/fixed

### BREAK

- 8-15 (15 min)

### Instructor Do: 05-Ins_Prototypes

- 815-30 (15 min)

  - Objects, arrays, and primitives all have a `.prototype.`

  - The `.prototype.` has methods and properties attached to it.

  - Methods declared on the prototype are declared once and memory is allocated for them once, but all objects made from it have access.

  - Instance methods only exist on a particular instance of an object, prototype methods are on all instances.

- debug the code in node, advancing section by section

- `.__proto__`

- `__proto__` is on instances

- `prototype` is on classes and is used to create `__proto__` on instances using `new`

- the `Movie` inherits the `prototype` from the `Object` class which includes things like `toString` and `hasOwnProperty`

- because of this protypical inheritance we can share the same methods (logInfo) across all instances while still having their own unique properties (name, release year)

### Student Do: 06-Stu_RPG-Prototypes

- 830-50 (20 min)

- create an RPG character

### Instructor Do: Review

- 850-9 (10 min)

- Why don't we just declare the methods in the constructor?

- When we bind a function using the `this` keyword, the method only exists on that instance of the object. For any method bound to `this`, it will be re declared with each new instance of an object.

- How does the prototype help us solve this problem?

- The prototype allows us to declare methods that will be attached to all instances of an object of that prototype. Because the method is applied to the prototype, it is only stored in memory once for all instances.

### Student Do: 07-Stu_Tamagotchi

- 9-25 (25 min)

### Instructor Do: Review

- 925-30 (5 min)

- Open [07-Stu_Tamagotchi/Solved/tamagotchi.js] in your IDE and explain the following to students:

  - We first create a constructor function named `DigitalPal`. It takes no arguments as the value of the keys are predefined.

  ```js
  const DigitalPal = function() {
    this.hungry = false;
    this.sleepy = false;
    this.bored = true;
    this.age = 0;
  };
  ```

  - We create a function `feed` and attach it to the `.prototype.`. The method `feeds` the DigitalPal when they are hungry and sets them to sleepy

  ```js
  DigitalPal.prototype.feed = function() {
    if (this.hungry) {
      console.log('That was yummy!');
      this.hungry = false;
      this.sleepy = true;
    } else {
      console.log("No thanks, I'm full.");
    }
  };
  ```

  - We create a method called `sleep`, which puts the DigitalPal to sleep when they are sleepy. It also invokes the `increaseAge` function.

  ```js
  DigitalPal.prototype.sleep = function() {
    if (this.sleepy) {
      console.log('ZZzzZZZzzZZz~~');
      this.sleepy = false;
      this.bored = true;
      this.increaseAge();
    } else {
      console.log("No way! I'm not tired!");
    }
  };
  ```

  - We create a method called `play` which allows the user to play with their DigitalPal when they are bored and sets hungry to `true` and bored to `false.`

  ```js
  DigitalPal.prototype.play = function() {
    if (this.bored) {
      console.log("Yay! Let's play!");
      this.bored = false;
      this.hungry = true;
    } else {
      console.log('Not right now. Maybe later?');
    }
  };
  ```

  - This is the `increaseAge` method which is called within our `sleep` method. It will increase the age of our DigitalPal by one.

  ```js
  DigitalPal.prototype.increaseAge = function() {
    this.age++;
    console.log('Happy Birthday to me! I am ' + this.age + ' old!');
  };
  ```

  - The `destroyFurniture` will allow us to decrease our `houseQuality`.

  ```js
  DigitalPal.prototype.destroyFurniture = function() {
    if (this.houseQuality - 10 > 0) {
      this.houseQuality -= 10;
      this.bored = false;
      this.sleepy = true;
      console.log('MUAHAHAHAHA! TAKE THAT FURNITURE!');
    } else {
      console.log("I've already destroyed it all!");
    }
  };
  ```

  - We create and attach a `letOutside` function to our prototype which will let our pet outside, and make them bark!

  ```js
  DigitalPal.prototype.letOutside = function() {
    if (!this.outside) {
      console.log('Yay! I love the outdoors!');
      this.outside = true;
      this.bark();
    } else {
      console.log("We're already outside though...");
    }
  };
  ```

  - We create and attach a `letInside` function to our prototype which will let our pet back inside.

  ```js
  DigitalPal.prototype.letInside = function() {
    if (this.outside) {
      console.log('Aww... Do I have to?');
      this.outside = false;
    } else {
      console.log("We're already inside though...");
    }
  };
  ```

  - Finally we can grab the command line arguments provided by the user and use store them in variables called `animal` and `method`.

  ```js
  const animal = process.argv[2];
  const method = process.argv[3];
  ```
