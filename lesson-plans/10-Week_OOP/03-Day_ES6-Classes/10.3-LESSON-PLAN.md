# 10.3 - ES6 Classes

## Overview

In this class, students will learn the benefits of OOP and learn how to apply many OOP practices to their JavaScript applications using ES6 classes.

- The primary focus of the class should be introducing students to OOP concepts. Let the students know that it's okay if the new syntax feels overwhelming. The purpose of this lesson is to help students get comfortable with working with code that's organized with OOP practices.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement ES6 class syntax to instantiate multiple instances of a single type of object.

- Construct subclasses that inherit features from a common ancestor class.

- Demonstrate "thinking in OOP" by using objects to control the flow of action in an application.

### Instructor Do: Welcome Students

- 10-1010 (10 min)

- Demo the mini-project word guesser (24)

- From an Object Oriented perspective, what are three objects we could create to represent this application?

  - game, word, letter

- What kinds of methods could we have inside the `game` object?

  - operations like initializing game, prompt for letters, ending game, keeping track of guess count

- What kinds of methods could we have inside the `word` object?

  - printing

  - check if word matches solution

- What kinds of methods could we have inside the `letter` object?

  - Display that character ( \_ or letter)

  - The purpose of pseudocoding here is to practice organizing our code in a way that models real life objects.

- Save the pseudocode file and keep it handy so that you can refer to it in the second half of class.

- Take a moment and look around the room. What kinds of objects are in this room and what kinds of properties/methods could they have?

  - A student might have the method `completeActivities`.

- In today's class, we'll be implementing the ES6 class syntax, but we're also going to focus on modeling our code in an object oriented way. This helps us keep our code modular, reusable, and oftentimes simple, since objects in our code can closely resemble objects in the real world.

### Students Do: 17-Stu-Prototype-Review

- 1010-25 (15 min)

- add a new prototype function to search for an actor (given search for a show)

### Instructor Do: Review

- 1025-30 (5 min)

### Instructor Do: 18-Ins-Classes

- 1030-40 (10 min)

- start with `shape.js`

- use lightbulb to convert to ES6 class

- changes

  - special function called `constructor`

  - class methods removes the `function` keyword, instead of `.prototype` or arrows

  - inheritance is still prototypical instead of classical, it's just syntactic sugar

### Student Do: 19-Stu-Classes

- 1040-55 (15 min)

- RPG game using the new class constructor syntax

### Instructor Do: Review

- 1055-11 (5 min)

### Instructor Do: 20-Ins-Subclasses

- 11-1110 (10 min)

- start with `shape`

- `rectangle` takes in different args and then calls `super()` on computed stuff

- when extending a class you must call `super` before using `this`

- `super` calls the parent constructor

- `super` can also be used to access methods and properties from the parent class

- rectangles have `printInfo` because it was inherited from `Shape`

  - draw prototype chain on whiteboard

- this was an internship interview question I had at HomeAway

### Student Do: 21-Stu-Subclasses

- 1110-25 (15 min)

- Create a class inheritance structure with vehicles (cars and boats)

### Instructor Do: Review

- 1125-30 (5 min)

- We use `crewSoundOff` to do something different with our passengers.

### Instructor Do: 22-Ins-Multiple-Classes

- 1130-35 (5 min)

- start with `item.js`

- then `order.js`

  - an order contains one item

  - we generate an id

  - `Order.lastId` is a **static** value. There is only one available across all instances - one per class

- then `restaurant.js`

- then `index.js`

### Student Do: 23-Stu-Multiple-Classes

- 1135-55 (20 min)

- Finish code for a toy store using multiple classes

### Instructor Do: Review

- 1155-12 (5 min)

  - Why did we write our store initialization and product processing in a separate file called `index.js` instead of including it inside `store.js`?

  - We break away from `store.js` in this activity so that we can run isolated unit tests. If we were to include all of our method calls in `store.js`, then trying to test individual methods in `store.js` would **also** cause all of the method calls to run.

### BREAK

- 12-40 (40 min)

### Instructor Do: Introduce Mini Project

- 1240-45 (5 min)

- demo the project

- Take a moment to try playing a game of word guess. In order to properly demonstrate a won game, it is recommended that you use `word.js` to guide your guesses.

  - We get different responses depending on whether or not our guess was successful.

  - If we guess correctly or run out of guesses, the game is over.

  - Lastly, we can choose to play another game or quit.

- Answer any lingering questions students have about the functionality of the app.

### Student Do: 24-Mini-Project

- 1245-145 (60 min)

### Instructor Do: Review

- 145-55 (10 min)

- start with `Game`

- `Letter`

  - In the constructor, we determine if a character is not a number or a letter, and if not, make it visible right away.

  - If the character should not be visible, return an underscore.

  - We transform the character and the guess to uppercase so that the guess is case insensitive.

- Open [24-Mini-Project/Solved/Word.js] in your IDE and explain the following:

  - In the constructor, we create a new `Letter` object for each character in the word string.

  - `getSolution` returns a string of all of the solved letters.

  - `guessLetter` checks to see if the user guessed correctly, then prints the word guessed so far.

  - `guessedCorrectly` uses `.every` to only return true if `letter.visible` is true for every letter.

- Open [24-Mini-Project/Solved/Game.js] in your IDE and explain the following:

  - The Game constructor is responsible for keeping score and controlling the flow of the overall game.

  - We define the `play` function to initialize a new game with a different word.

  - `nextWord` grabs a random word from `words.js` and prompts the user for a guess.

  - `makeGuess` prompts the user for a guess. If they have no guesses remaining, show them the solution, then ask if they want to play again.

  - If the user guessed the word correctly, we reset the guesses and prompt them with another word.

  - `askToPlayAgain` prompts the user to play again. If they do not, we exit the node process.

  - `askForLetter` is in charge of prompting users for letters, then running `guessLetter` to determine whether or not they've guessed correctly.
