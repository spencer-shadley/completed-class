# 20.2 - The React Context API

### Welcome

- 630-45 (5 min)

- slides don't start yet

### Stu: 08-Stu_PropDrilling

- 645-705 (20 min)

- update the given gallery app to use prop drilling

- give one example of drilling a prop in the activity

- many resources provided at bottom of readme

- draw how the state is pulled up

### Ins: Review

- 705-15 (15 min)

- `Gallery.js`

  - stateful container with logic like making API requests

  - API responses are stored as state

  - ask: how else could we have represented this state?

    - we may want to group the user logic into its own state object

      - data related to each other should be kept together

        - alternatively could combine `userIndex` and `user` together

  - `useEffect`

    - after the component mounts we run `loadUsers` to make an API call for the users

    - this updates the state for users

  - finally we `return` (render) our components

    - the `CardContainer` depends on the user's name so we pass it in along with an image, language and email

    - we also pass in a function that knows how to move to the next image `handleBtnClick`

- `CardContainer`

  - accepts all that we passed in as props

  - all it does is hand them over to `Card`

- `Card`

  - accepts them all as props

  - renders a few components

  - each component gets its own set of props to render

- `CardHeading`

  - renders the title

  - `alt+-` to go back

- `CardImg`

  - renders the image

- `CardBody`

  - renders props

- `CardBtn`

  - `onClick` calls in the passed in function, calling the function all the way back in `Gallery`

  - sets `data-value` to know which button was clicked

- intermediate components don't even care, they're just there to keep the data alive

- ask: What is this technique called? (prop-drilling)

- ask: What are the pros and cons of prop drilling?

  - it's easy to add, very low complexity to start adding

  - complexity tends to grow as the tree grows

  - tightly coupled components

  - breaking encapsulation - some components need to know about things they shouldn't know about

- ask: Is there another component where we could make the API call?

  - We could make the API call from the image component itself, but we avoid doing that since we want the purpose of the image component to be presentational only.

### Ins: Giving Context Slides

- 715-25 (10 min)

### Ins: 09-Ins_useContext

- 725-35 (10 min)

- this is an alternative to prop drilling which provides a more global access to state

- three steps to Context

  1. Create a Context provider
  1. Wrap an ancestor component with that provider
  1. `useContext` to read that value

- same app as before but with global state

- `DeveloperContext.js`

  - Creates and exports a new Context object initialized with default values

  - this is the "context", or info, other components need and depend on to function

- `Developer.js`

  - `useContext` hook to replace the need for a `contextConsumer` mentioned in React docs

    - takes in a `Context` object

- we aren't quite done yet. We still need to wrap an ancestor component with a context provider

- `App.js`

  - we wrap our components in a `DeveloperContext.Provider` which will consume the state with a passed in `developerState`

  - we still use props like normal - `changeMood` as an example

- go back to `DeveloperInfo` and reiterate that it can receive all of these props from context

- that context is available in every descendant element

- show `Nav.js` which also consumes the context

### Stu: 10-Stu_useContext

- 735-50 (15 min)

### Ins: Review

- 750-8 (10 min)

- `ArticleContext.js`

  - creates context with properties that need to be shared (excludes `search`)

- `Search.js`

  - wrap the render in an `ArticleContext.Provider` and pass in the state

- `SearchResults.js`

  - `useContext` to get the state to render

  - no longer do we depend on our parent to give us this data

### BREAK

- 8-15 (15 min)

### Ins: 11-Ins_DynamicContext

- 815-25 (10 min)

- demo the app

- `AlertContext.js`

  - creates a context

  - provides default values using an anonymous object

    - they get overwritten, we just need to make sure the types match

- `App.js`

  - state is initialized to some values

    - the click updates our state

  - render is wrapped in the `AlertContext`

- `Home.js`

  - no props or state needed

  - just dumbly renders the `Content` component

- `Content.js`

  - `useContext` from the alert

  - renders three buttons and calls the click from `useContext` state

  - renders `Alert` with the given `type`

- `Alert.js` only depends on the props passed in

### Stu: 12-Stu_DynamicContext

- 825-45 (20 min)

### Ins: Review

- 845-55 (10 min)

- one context object is used for many places

- `Gallery.js`

  - wraps in a provider with as minimal access as possible - only given to `CardContainer`

  - passed in different values as I found I needed them

    - `user` properties bundled together as one object

  - drill into the components, reaching `Card`

    - several components rendered here

      - `CardImg` needs the `image`

      - `CardTitleText` inside `CardHeading` needs the `user` and `capitalizeFirstLetter`

      - `CardBtn` needs the `handleBtnClick` to advance

      - each time I see shared state I update `userContext.js`

- `userContext.js`

  - contains the state we need for the other components

  - initialize some data which will be overwritten in the provider, just make sure types are right

- ask: did anyone have more than one context?

  - images and titles could have been different but would be overkill for such a small app

  - in larger apps there will several component layers with different providers (next demo)

### Ins: 13-Ins_MultipleContexts

- 855-905 (10 min)

- with complex applications multiple context are often necessary

- it's an art deciding how many context objects and at what levels they belong

  - tradeoffs

  - minimize as much as possible

  - multiple contexts can help separate concerns, preventing components that shouldn't know about some data from knowing about it

- demo the buttons again

- `App.js`

  - we now have `getUserToken` which returns a fake token

  - our state is now two pieces - `user` and `alert`

  - we also have to worry about the current theme

  - the render includes three nested providers (we can order however we like)

  - `Alert` and `User` providers receive state objects as their value and the theme provider receives a string literal

- `Home.js`

  - gets the theme context and renders `Content`

- `Content.js`

  - gets the alert context and renders `Alert`

- `Nav.js` (rendered from `App.js`)

  - `NavLink`

    - gets the user context

### Stu: 14-Stu_MultipleContexts

- 905-20 (15 min)

- demo that the app now has a language view

### Ins: Review

- 920-30 (10 min)

- `UserContext` and `LanguageContext`

  - separates the user information and the language

- `Gallery.js`

  - has both providers

- `LanguageSelector`

- `LanguageContext`

- `CardContainer > Card > CardHeading > ...` has what we used earlier

## Bonus lecture - recursion

- we can have a function call another function, what do you think would happen if that function we called is the same function?

- live code building to `printCountdownToZero`

  - add one with an infinite loop (just prints)

  - add a base case

  - make it smaller

- tail recursion vs traditional recursion

  - live code building towards `countdownToZero.js`

- code `factorial.js`

- downsides

  - memory (stackoverflow)

    - modern machines put a limit in place on the number of stacks will keep in memory, exceeding it causes a stackoverflow

- `factorial`

- `fibonacci`
