# 20.1 - Intro to React Hooks

third party hooks is optional, can spend much more time on activities

### Ins: Hooks Slide and Discussion

- 630-50 (20 min)

- mostly on kahoot

- advantages to managing state like this - simple, straightforward, component and children will re-render with up-to-date data

- disadvantages - updating state from nested components can be difficult, state flows one-way, state can flow deep

- there is no one-size fits all solution for state management

- Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from stateless components.

- Only call Hooks from top-level components. This means **never** call Hooks from within loops, conditionals, or nested functions.

- Do not call hooks from within regular JavaScript functions.
  This makes it so that all stateful logic is easy to find for the developer (you).

### Ins: Intro

- TODO: live code a simple example

### Ins: 01-Ins_useState

- 650-7 (10 min)

- 'status' defaults to 'content'

- 'encourage laziness' switches it to 'lazy'

- `App.js`

  - import `useState`

- we call `useState` initializing the state

  - built-in hook that always returns an array of two elements

    - current state

    - function to overwrite the current state

  - state is destructured to get each of these out as `developerState` and `setDeveloperState`

  - when called we need to use the spread syntax because it will overwrite the state, unlike `setState`

### Stu: 02-Stu_useState

- 7-15 (15 min)

- signup page, have it update the page using `useState`

- if behind make this 10 minutes

### Ins: Review

- 715-25 (10 min)

- `src/pages/Signup/index.js`

  - no default values

  - we don't use `value`, we use `onChange`

    - This is for a controlled input

      - **Controlled input** accepts its current value as a prop and has a callback that allows you to change its value. Whenever `onChange` updates its value, it's essentially the input controlling itself.

      - **Uncontrolled input** is an input that gets its value from somewhere else. In our case, if `value={username}`, then the input would be getting its value from the state.

      - The combination of the two would result in the component going from uncontrolled to controlled, which is considered bad practice.

### Ins: 03-Ins_useEffect

- 725-35 (10 min)

- effect meaning side effect

  - this can be manipulating the DOM (outside of our component), setting up a subscription or manipulating data in a database

    - it is a combined `componentDidMount`, `comonentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount`

    - these should happen after render, we want them to happen after React updates the DOM

- if you are changing something outside of the react component, you are creating an effect that should be managed with `useEffect`

- "Think of effects as an escape hatch from React’s purely functional world into the imperative world" -React

- effects run after every completed render, can opt to only fire them when certain values have changed

- a returned function inside `useEffect` allows cleanup opportunity

  ```js
  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = props.source.subscribe();
    return () => {
      // Clean up the subscription
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    };
  });
  ```

  - `useLayoutEffect` is a related hook that is fired synchronously before the next paint

  - the second argument to `useEffect` is an array of the values (props or state) that the effect depends on to limit how frequently it is fired

    - an empty array means that you don't depend on any values from props or state so it never needs to re-run

- `App.js`

  - `useEffect` has two parameters

    - function to run after the component mounts

    - array of dependencies (deps)

      - every time the component re-renders the `useEffect` hook will check if any values in its dependency array have changed. If so, it runs the function again.

- demo clicking the buttons

  - useEffect is called after the API call completes

### Stu: 04-Stu_useEffect

- 735-55 (20 min)

- switch an app to use react hooks

### Ins: Review

- 755-805 (10 min)

- `index.js`

  - lots of `useState`, one for each state member

    - splitting them apart makes our code more readable and managing state more predictable

    - search gets a default

  - `useEffect` to search wikipedia based on user input

    - anytime the search is updated the effect is fired

    - also fires immediately, once the component has mounted

    - have an early return in case the input is empty

  - `handleInputChange` updates our state using `setSearch` hook

- Ask students the following questions:

  - What was the point of this? (Feel free to make a bad pun here).

    - Writing functional components is much cleaner. Using Hooks allows you to write fewer lines of code and manage your state in a less complex way. (No `this` keyword required!)

  - If we use Hooks, can state be used by other components?

    - No. The state used within a single component cannot be used by different components.

  - Can you think of a concept that would allow us to share state across components?

    - We can add this functionality by using the Context API with the built in `useContext` Hook.

### BREAK

- 805-20 (15 min)

### Ins: 05-simple-custom-hook

- 820-30 (10 min)

- replaced the given ins_customhook

- ask: what are the two rules of hooks?

  - Only call Hooks from top-level components. This means **never** call Hooks from within loops, conditionals, or nested functions.

  - Hooks may only be called from React components. **Never** call a Hook from a regular JavaScript function.

- custom hooks

  - just a wrapper around existing hooks

  - reuse stateful logic between components

    - used to either use higher-order components (transforms a component into another component, a container) and render props (value of prop is a function)

    - custom hooks enable doing this without adding more components to your tree

  - if a function's name start with "use" and it calls other hooks we call it a custom hook

    - it's more of a convention that an actual feature

  - they are a way to share stateful **logic**

  - Custom Hooks are a great way to keep your React functions pure.

- third rule for custom hooks - name must be prefixed with `use`

- these still don't share state - to do that we need `useContext`

- show `StudentListNoCustomHooks`

  - uses a few existing hooks to make API calls to show list of students

  - this stateful list of students may be useful in other components

  - refactored to use custom hooks

  - `utils/useStudentList.js`

  - `StudentListCustomHooks` (and update `App.js`)

### Stu: 06-Stu_CustomHook

- 830-45 (15 min)

- In this activity we will practice using Custom Hooks by creating a `useDebounce` Hook that will delay the invoking of a function for a given number of milliseconds.

- demo the final solution and explain what debounce is

### Ins: Review

- 845-55 (10 min)

- search in the article search bar

  - it only updates after finished typing

  - type again but slowly

- `index.js`

  - custom hook owns `useEffect` and `useState`

- `utils/debounceHook.js`

### Stu: 07-Stu_ThirdPartyHooks

- 855-915 (20 min)

- can skip if needed, allow more time for hooks

- If time permits, introduce students to [16-ThirdPartyHooks/Unsolved/]. Since this activity uses third party Hooks, only proceed with this activity if the students seem to have a solid grasp of Hooks. Otherwise, spend the rest of class answering lingering questions, reviewing, and skimming over the solution with the class.

  - In this activity we will practice using third party Hooks. Specifically, we will be creating a survey form using the `react-hanger` package on npm.

  - Let the students know that `react-hanger` is one of many custom Hooks packages on GitHub. This package contains multiple custom

  - Start the application in dev mode by running `npm run start` in your terminal.

  - Open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and study the rendered application.

    - There are a few fields in our survey form. Before writing any code, try thinking about how you would manage the state of this form.

  - Navigate to the [react-hanger docs](https://github.com/kitze/react-hanger) familiarize yourself with the `useInput`, `useBoolean`, and `useNumber` Hooks.

  - Update this application to accomplish the following:

    - Each user input should be handled using the `react-hanger` Hooks.

    - When the user clicks an emoji, indicate which type of response they selected by displaying the text: `You responded that you feel FEELING`. `FEELING` should be replaced with the value of the emoji that they clicked.

    - Make your survey form a little more dynamic by displaying a field for additional comments when the user clicks on an emoji.

    - When the form is submitted, `console.log` an object containing all of the values from the form.

### Ins: Review

- 915-25 (10 min)

- Replace your React application's src directory with [16-ThirdPartyHooks/Solved].

- Demonstrate that the application satisfies the requirements:

  - Fill out each field in the form with dummy data.

  - Click `submit`.

  - Open the console and show that the form object contains the value from each field.

- Open [Survey/index.js solved] in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  - Even though we used `textarea` instead of `input`, we can still use the `useInput` hook.

  - `showComment` is initialized to `false` so that the additional input field is not visible initially.

  - Since we will be setting the rating manually, we do not need to give it upper and lower bounds.

  - Our form object contains the value of each field. Since `showComment` is only used for display purposes, we do **not** include it in the form object.

  - `...favoriteThing.eventBind` binds both the `value` and the `onChange` props of an element, as long as it has a `event.target.value`.

  - This single method would also work with input fields and select elements.

  - It is very important that we include `role="img"` and `aria-label="angry"` to make the emojis accessible.

  - The onClick method toggles our `showComment` boolean and sets the feeling value to angry.

  - We use a ternary operator so that the additional comments textarea only renders if the `showComment` boolean is true.

  - Once again, `onClick` and `value` are bound to the comment variable.

- Recommend students go through the following material at home before next class if possible. These articles will help them better understand the material covered today in class.

bonus from `05-Ins_CustomHook`

- update the `name` input

  - multiple components update with that state

- `utils/useUserModel.js`

  - this is just a function, not a component

  - we still can use react hooks

  - creates an object where each property has a `name` and `onChange` property (kind of like `useState` handles updating data)

  - this is a custom hook

    - we name it with `use` to signify that

    - it has default values for state

    - it has logic for detecting errors

    - it easily enables changing a fixed set of properties

- `App.js`

  - we create our custom hook `useUserModel` here

  - `useEffect` is only called to log the model when it changes

  - we want to share state as well, we are updating multiple components

  - create a `Context` object called `UserContext`

- `UserForm.js`

  - uses that custom hook for context

## Bonus lecture - yarn

supplemental has yarn overview

maybe do a demo of this, or show with create-react-app
