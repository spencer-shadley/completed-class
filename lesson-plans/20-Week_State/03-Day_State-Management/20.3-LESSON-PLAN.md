# 20.3 - State Management with the Store

## Overview

In this class, students will learn the benefits of declarative Redux-style code and implement an architecture that mirrors Redux with a store, reducer, and actions.

- You should scaffold out a React application with Create React App at the beginning of class and suggest students do the same. The activities we go over today will only include the applications `src` directory which you should replace in your React app's boilerplate to avoid repetitive installs. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

- Today's lesson will rely heavily on Redux concepts. It is recommended that you spend some time getting familiar with the activities before class starts.

## Learning Objectives

- Transform an app that manages state in Container components into one that follows a Redux pattern.

- Identify the appropriate time to make a React app use Redux or follow a similar design pattern.

- Grasp general concepts of declarative, pure, immutable functions, in a way that is abstracted from Redux or any particular library.

- Implement a Redux-like store in a React app.

### Ins: Introduction

- 10-10 (10 min)

- first half of class we will learn about Redux

- second half will be a mini-project to create your own CMS (content management system) with redux

- react context is still just pulling up the state - an ancestor component owns the state

- redux stores it separately from the components

- entire state of app is stored in an object tree inside a store

  - this state tree is modified by emitting an action (object which describes what should happen)

  - to specifiy how actions transform the state tree you write pure reducers

- draw the redux flow

  - old_state + action => new_state

  - separate from main app, instead of inside the component tree

### Ins: 16-Ins_useReducer

- 1010-30 (20 min)

- we won't have much time today to actually cover redux so I'm adding this overview of how redux would interact with a react app and then showing how react can mimic this built-in

- after giving a full overview we'll dive into each area with smaller activities

- start from `redux-unsolved`

  - `package.json`

    - need to install `redux`

  - `App.js`

    1. create a reducer which describes how to transform the state - old_state + action = new_state
    1. create a store (`let store = createStore(counter)`)
    1. dispath (perform) the action

    ```js
    import React from 'react';
    import { createStore } from 'redux';

    function increment(state = 0, action) {
      if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {
        return state + 1;
      }
      return state;
    }

    let store = createStore(
      increment,
      window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ &&
        window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
    );

    store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
    store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
    store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });

    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
          <h1>{store.getState()}</h1>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

  - add a breakpoint on the `dispath` and show with a watch expression

  - demo the redux dev tools including time travel

  - add a decrement

    - `increment` rename to `counter`
    - switch inside the `counter` on `type`
    - add a `store.dispatch({type: 'DECREMENT'});`

    ```js
    function counter(state = 0, action) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
          return state + 1;
        case 'DECREMENT':
          return state - 1;
        default:
          return state;
      }
    }
    ```

  - add buttons

    ```js
    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
          <h1>{store.getState()}</h1>
          <button onClick={() => store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>
            +
          </button>
          <button onClick={() => store.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>
            -
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

  - show that the store is updating but react isn't displaying it

    - we need to add `react-redux` to integrate redux into react

  - `index.js`

    - we need to wrap our entire application in a `Provider` to give context to the app of our new store

    - this means we will also need to move our store and counter over

    ```js
    import { createStore } from 'redux';
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

    function counter(state = 0, action) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
          return state + 1;
        case 'DECREMENT':
          return state - 1;
        default:
          return state;
      }
    }

    let store = createStore(
      counter,
      window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ &&
        window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
    );

    ReactDOM.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <Provider store={store}>
          <App />
        </Provider>
      </React.StrictMode>,
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
    ```

  - `App.js`

    - we can import `useSelector` to read state and `useDispatch` to update state

    - `useDispath` takes in an action (normally as a separate function)

    ```js
    import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
    function App() {
      const dispatch = useDispatch();
      return (
        <div className="App">
          <h1>{useSelector(state => state)}</h1>
          <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>+</button>
          <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>-</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

  - demo the app and show the time travel debugger now updates the UI

  - this is redux, we can mostly achieve this with what's built-in with react

- `react-reducer-solved` version which achieves this with what's directly in react

  - demo app

  - `App.js`

  - `useReducer`

    - in the callback we get our old_state and an action (requested action)

    - we return the new state

    - returned is an array with the new state and a `dispatch` to run the reducer

  - we call dispatch to run an action

### Stu: 17-Stu_useReducer

- 1030-45 (15 min)

- add buttons to praise dogs using a react reducer hook

### Ins: Review

- 1045-55 (10 min)

- `App.js`

  - two actions - one for each "dog"

### Ins: 18-Ins_useRef

- 1055-1105 (10 min)

- demo app

- `App.js`

  - `useRef` is a hook that allows getting a reference to another element

  - we set the input attribute `ref` to our created ref so that we can reference it

  - we could have used `onChange` but wanted to make the input field _uncontrolled_ since we only need the value when the form is submitted

    - requires less code

    - component is not unnecessarily subscribed to a value that frequently changes

### Stu: 19-Stu_useRef

- 1055-1110 (15 min)

- update a todo app to use reducer and ref hooks

### Ins: Review

- 1110-20 (10 min)

- all in `App.js`

- we setup a ref on our input

- dispatch on submit

- id would normally come from a DB

### Ins: 20-Ins_Store

- 1120-30 (10 min)

- demo app - basically the same but now we are keeping counter data in a global state called `store`

- we now split apart our files

  - as our code grows we would need to do this

  - redux also expects a large number of files

- `App`

  - entire app is wrapped in a `CountProvider`

  - go into `CountProvider` definition

- `GlobalState`

  - to have a global contextual state we need to create a new context

    - we get the provider out of that context to wrap and serve to other components

  - we setup a reducer which supports adding and subtracting

    - other components will be able to dispatch actions to be reduced to a new state and this is where that logic is handled

    - the reducer is not connected to the `userReducer` hook until we create our `CountProvider`

    - the reducer itself is abstract, it can be used by other providers as well

  - our `CountProvider` allows providing props which it then forwards to whichever underlying component is rendered

  - `useCountContext` prevents having to import both `useContext` and `CountContext`

  - just based on the name we would expect a `Provider` to have a `createContext` and create an exported provider object

  - where else might we find `GlobalState` based on its name?

    - any component that uses the global state

  - this contains what, in Redux, would be called a store

    - it handles all actions passed to it from any component

    - when a reducer handles an action it creates a new state and passes it through the provider to the global context object

- `Count.js`

  - we get the count context which includes our state and dispatch

  - on each click we call our dispatch

### Stu: 21-Stu_Store

- 1130-50 (20 min)

- refactor the TODO app to use a store

- demo the app (have it running on another port)

### Ins: Review

- 1150-12 (10 min)

- `App.js`

  - now very simple - components have moved out to their own files

  - wrapped in a `TodoProvider` so each has context with the store

- `GlobalState`

  - create a new context and set the initial values to match type (best practice, not required)

  - get the `Provider` from the context

  - setup a reducer which supports each of our actions

    - this gets called on `dispatch`

    - the state is an array so we need to create an updated array each time

  - create our `TodoProvider`

    - returns a new `Provider` where the value is our state and dispatch from the reducer

  - `useTodoContext` to avoid having to import `useContext`

- `Form.js`

  - `useRef` to get our input

  - `useTodoContext` to get global state from our store

  - `onSubmit` we dispatch our action

    - our `ref` is used so we can use the input's value

- `TodoList`

  - get our global store so we have gloabl state access

  - for every todo item we identify them using the index in the array

### Break

- 12-30 (30 min)

### Ins: Demo 22-Stu_Mini_Project

- 1230-35 (5 min)

- `mongod`

- `npm run start`

- go to http://localhost:3000

- create a blog post

  - title and body reset

  - screen name does not reset

- `Loading...` is at the top right in the navigation bar

  - while loading `Save Post` button is disabled

- favorites on the right

- click `View all posts`, click the new post

- click `Favorite`

- go home

- favorite list is populated

- click the 'x' to remove it

- favorites are only stored in the `store`, not in the database

### Stu: 22-Stu_Mini_Project

- 1235-150 (75 min)

### Ins: Review

- 150-2 (10 min)

- `actions.js`

  - First, we exported each string as a `const` so that we won't have to worry about misspelling our actions at any point in our application. This also allows us to take advantage of the autocomplete feature in our IDE.

  - It is also considered best practice in Redux to make all of your action types capitalized. This makes it much easier for you to quickly find actions in your code.

  - Let the students know that we'll return to the `Favorites` actions if there's time.

  - At the top, we import all of the action types from our actions file.

  - Walkthrough each case in our switch statement:

  - `SET_CURRENT_POST` returns a _new_ state object by combining the previous state with the `post` object from the `action`. We also set the loading property in our state to be `false`.

  - `UPDATE_POSTS` also returns a _new_ state object. This time, we created a _new_ array by using the spread operator on the posts array from the action. Again, we set the loading property in our state to be `false`.

  - `REMOVE_POST` returns a _new_ state object. The posts array is created by using the `filter` method on the posts array from our previous state. Remember, the `filter` method returns a _new_ array instead of mutating the existing one.

  - `ADD_POST` returns a _new_ state object. We create a new array from the post object from the `action` and the posts from the previous state. Again, we set the loading property in our state to be `false`.

  - `LOADING` returns a _new_ state object with loading set to `true`.

  - The `Store Provider` uses the `useReducer` Hook so that we can provide the global state to all of our components.

  - The second argument in the `useReducer` Hook is the initial state.

  - `dispatch` is also provided globally so that all components can use the reducer.

- `createPostForm.js`

  - We create separate `ref`s for each input field.

  - The `useStoreContext` Hook is called so that we have access to the store.

  - `handleSubmit` dispatches the `LOADING` action _before_ calling the API.

  - We save our post with `API.savePost`, then dispatch an action to update the store.

  - Both the `titleRef` and `bodyRef` are set back to empty strings.

  - Each `ref` Hook is attached to its respective input field.

  - The button has a `disabled` attribute that activates if `state.loading` is true.

- Open [PostsList.js] and explain the following:

  - The `removePost` function takes in the id argument and executes `API.deletePost(id)`. Once the deletion is complete, we dispatch an action to remove the post from our store. We pass the id property to the store so that the store will be able to use the `filter` method.

  - `useEffect` is called with no dependencies. This means our `getPosts` method will only run after the component first renders.

  - The ternary operation renders our posts _only_ if there are posts in the state. Otherwise, it will return a heading that let's the user know they haven't created any posts yet.

  - By mapping each one of the posts to a `ListItem`, we can display its properties and pass its `_id` to the `removePost` method.

- Open [Detail] and explain the following:

  - The `useEffect` Hook has no dependencies, so it will only run once when the component mounts.

  - We use `ADD_FAVORITE` and `REMOVE_FAVORITE` actions that mirror the `ADD_POST` and `REMOVE_POST` actions.

  - A ternary operator determines whether to show the `Remove from Favorites` or `Add to Favorites` button based on whether or not the `currentPost` is within the current state's `favorites` array.
