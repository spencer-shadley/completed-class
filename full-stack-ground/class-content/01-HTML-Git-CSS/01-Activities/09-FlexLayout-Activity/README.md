# Don't be a floater

- Introduce yourself to 1â€“2 people next to you.

- Then using `flex.html` and `flex.css` as a starting point, work together to create the missing CSS necessary to form the layout shown to you on screen.

- This will not be easy so work at it as best you can. This is a challenging activity. At the very least, try to increase your understanding of CSS properties.

### Hint

- Concentrate on first figuring out how to create the boxes. Think about using background colors (CSS property: `background`).

- We've provided the styling you need for the header element. Use this as a starting point to style the others.

- You will need to apply each of the following CSS properties at least once:

  - `flex`

  - `flex-grow`

  - `flex-direction`

  - `align-items`

  - `justify-content`

  - `text-align`

  - `border`

  - `padding`

  - `margin`

  - `background`

  - `width` (read up on width by percents)

  - `color`

  - `height`

- If you finish early Slack the TAs or raise your hand to call their attention. TAs will reassign you to help others in the class.
