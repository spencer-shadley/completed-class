- Today we are going to cover mongoose, an ODM

  - type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more out of the box

  - schema - rules for data

  - CRUD with mongoose

  - build relationships between collections

- Now that we are 2/3rds of the way through let's talk about career services

  - talk to Jen with questions

### Stu: 09-Stu-MongoJS-Review

- 645-705 (20 min)

- let's review mongojs

- demo the app

- they will add routes to display and edit book data

### Ins: Review

- 705-15 (10 min)

- notice that we don't need a route for root, instead we are using `express.static`

### Ins: 10-Ins-Mongoose-Schema

- 715-25 (10 min)

- SQL can be hard to write and breaks up our flow of object oriented javascript programming so we added sequelize for an ORM

- NoSQL has Object Data Modeling (ODM) and we will use one called mongoose

  - Mongoose lets you define schemas for your collections.

  - It also helps manage data relationships and enforce validations.

- start with `server.js`

- then `exampleModel.js`

- different types have different validators

  - numbers have `min` and `max`

  - strings have `enum`, `match`, `minlength` and `maxlength`

- ask: what are the benefits of mongoose? why do we want this?

  - It let's use create a schema, enforce validations and overall make it easier to interface with a Mongoose database.

### Stu: 11-Stu-Mongoose-Schema

- 725-45 (20 min)

- demo the app (add conflicting emails)

### Ins: Review

- 745-55 (10 min)

- `match` is a string validator for a regular expression

### BREAK

- 755-810 (15 min)

### Ins: 12-Ins-Custom-Methods

- 810-20 (10 min)

- we can create custom methods with mongoose for manipulating our data

- start by demo'ing app

- then `server.js`

- then `userModel.js`

### Stu: 13-Stu-Custom-Methods

- 820-35 (15 min)

- experiment with adding your own custom methods

### Ins: Review

- 835-40 (5 min)

### Ins: 14-Ins-Populate

- 840-50 (10 min)

- demo the app

- we add a book

- after we add a book, what if we want to add that book to our library

  - we could go back to books and query them

  - but what if we want to also show library info like hours?

  - two calls?

  - mongoose has a system to "populate" referenced data

- show `Book.js`

- show `Library.js`

- show `index.js`

  - this is really common when working with multiple models

- show `server.js`

### Stu: 15-Stu-Populate

- 850-910 (20 min)

- using a note taker, try using populate between notes and users

### Ins: Review

- 910-20 (10 min)

```js
app.get(`/populateduser`); // added route
```
