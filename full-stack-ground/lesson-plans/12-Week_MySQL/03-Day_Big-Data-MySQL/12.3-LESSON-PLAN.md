# 12.3 - My-Massive-SQL

### Ins: Introduction to Big Data

- 10-15 (15 min)

- This is an easier day which reviews the past week

- Importing data + review

- Big data - only difference is the amount of data

- slidedeck

- ends early, can stretch this

### Stu: 12-Top5000Schema (Part 1)

- 1015-25 (10 min)

- `TopSongs.csv` contains 5000 lines of music data

- The column names are in the hints

- In MySQL we can create schemas to avoid having to setup a database/table on every new machine

- We also can add `seeds.sql` files to save statements used to insert data into the tables

### Ins: Review

- 1025-1030 (5 min)

- Just review the columns that people want to make (name, type, size, nullable) - don't show the SQL statements

- `DECIMAL(X, Y)` is a decimal with X digits of precision (1-38 allowed), Y of them used for the decimal digits

### Stu: Preparing the Database (Part 2)

- 1030-50 (20 min)

- Create the actual queries for it

### Ins: Review

- 1050-11 (10 min)

- Show the actual SQL

### Ins: Importing Data Demo

- 11-10 (10 min)

- Show that `SELECT` is empty

- Click the Import from the table view

  - If it says "Not responding" it's probably lying

- Might need to click "Apply" in the bottom right

- Run the `SELECT` to show the full data now

### Stu: 13-Top5000Code

- 1110-1140

- (30 min)

- Import the data set and then build a Node app which interacts with it

- Tell the students a break is up next and then review

### BREAK

- 1140-1220 (40 min)

### Ins: Review

- 1220-35 (15 min)

- `GROUP BY` - groups rows with related values and can be combined with aggregate functions like count, max, min, sum or avg. This will change the order it's displayed and enables combining (aggregating) rows. It finds rows with shared values for the columns being grouped together.

- `BETWEEN ? AND ?` allows us to select information between a specific range.

- be careful with `WHERE`, `BETWEEN` and `JOIN` because it requires examining a large number of rows which may not be performant

  - we can index columns. This will take data from a column and store it alphabetically in a separate location called an index. When the data needs to be accessed to searches this shorter indexed list and then looks at the rows from when a match is found.

  - Add an index using `ADD INDEX`

    `ALTER TABLE top5000 ADD INDEX song (song)`

  - now when querying based on song title it will be much faster

  - MySQL automatically creates an index for the table's primary key

  - What is appropriate to index varies on a case-by-case basis

  - This is super tiny data, we won't notice a difference

  - Draw an index on the table for songs (another table in alphabetical order)

### Stu: 14-TwoTables

- 1235-135 (60 min)

- Data often has relationships that we can take advantage of

- Songs and albums provided

- A database usually has many related tables

### Everyone Do: Going Over Two Tables

- 135-50 (15 min)

- Ask if anyone adding something cool that they'd be willing to share
