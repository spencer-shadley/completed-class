## Description

This app is to demonstrate how to use jquery ajax and manipulate the DOM to display gifs and 'facts' about Chuck Norris.

- You can select a 'fact' category

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="./images/select-options.png" alt="app gif"/>
  </div>

- I will display a gif and a quote based on what was selected

 <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="./images/quote.png" alt="app gif"/>
  </div>

- You can pause and animate gif

 <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-around">
    <img src="./images/still-button.png" alt="app gif" width="50%"/>
    <img src="./images/animate-button.png" alt="app gif" width="50%"/>
  </div>

Take a look at the `script.js` and look through. See you if understand the different parts of the code and how they interact with each other. I left some comments to the activity where that code concept was introduce.

## Tips and Tricks

After the last assigment many people ask me how to get unstuck when you don't know what to do next or even how to start. In preparation for your first project below are a few tips and tricks that I have come across. As always you can google fu other approaches and ideas.

## Some Perspective

Sometimes our inner critic voice can be really loud. Comparing ourself to others; making us doubt ourselves and the skills we have learned. Always remember everyone starts at the beginning. With time and perseverance anyone can learn anything. To give you some perspective on this here a blog I wrote about [my journey](https://formidable.com/blog/2018/one-dancers-journey/) in becoming a developer. Also, here is a video from [dotCSS 2018 conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqZqx6lRPe0) where a colorblind designer, David DeSandro, describes how to read color hex code. I like this video because he took something that could have stop him from becoming a designer and turn it into a 'super power'. Happy Coding!
