## Presentation Requirements

Use this [project presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_u8TKy5zW5UlrVQVnyDEZ0unGI2tjQPDEpA0FNuBKAw/edit?usp=sharing) to address the following:

- Links to to the deployed application and the GitHub repository

## Recommended

It is strongly recommended that you additionally include and use:

- Agile development (hold regular standups, build something small and add to it)

- Many unit tests (in production, test code usually exceeds the amount of product code)

- Continuous Integration (such as `Travis`)

- A linter (such as `ESLint`)

- Model View Controller (MVC)

- RESTful architecture

- UML diagram

- Code coverage tooling (such as `coveralls`)

  - Code coverage integrated into your CI
