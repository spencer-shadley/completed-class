# Unit 16: Project 2 Continued

## Overview
Welcome to Project 2! This is yet another important milestone in your full-stack journey: designing and building your first full-stack web application. You and your team will design and build an app using the MVC paradigm and your own server-side API. You will also continue to add to your professional repertoire with testing, continuous integration and linting tools.

### Regional Content

Starting in this unit, you will have access to Regional content.

This content is self-paced, self-guided, and designed to help you to continue to learn new skills after the boot camp has ended.
