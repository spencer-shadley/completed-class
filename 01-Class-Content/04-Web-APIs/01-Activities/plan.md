03 Traverse DOM (1045-55)

Review (1055-11)
"What other properties or attributes can be set using JS?“
-Anything

04 Setting Attributes (11-1110)
Open index.html
How do we feel about this style?
Uncomment the script
We can use querySelector and querySelectorAll rather than traversing the DOM tree
We can use setAttribute to modify the HTML attributes of an element

05 Setting Attributes (1110-20) (10 min)
It’s on GitLab

Review (1120-25)
setAttribute takes a property and a value

Break 1125-1205 (40 min)

06 Create Append (1205-15)
Demo first
createElement
appendChild

(student) 07 – Look Ma no HTML (1215-45) (30 min)

Review (1245-50)

08 – Timers and Intervals (1250-100)
Where are timers used in apps? (countdowns, calendars, games)
Demo index.html
Colors after a time
How did we do this?
setInterval

timerInterval is stored in a variable
Decrement seconds

Mention setTimeout
They live on window (not document)

Ask: Why do we need to clearInterval?
If we don’t it will indefinitely
setTimeout has clearTimeout
