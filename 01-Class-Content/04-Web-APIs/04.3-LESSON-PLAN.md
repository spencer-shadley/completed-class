# 4.3 Lesson Plan: Client Side Storage (6:30PM)

### Instructor Do: Preview Client Side Storage (5 mins)

630-35

Today is a big class - originally scheduled to be 4.5 hours. We will be skipping a few activities but all are still included (solved and unsolved) in the class repo.

TAs: keep updating for the skipped activities

For almost half of class we'll be building a timer

[TODO list](file:///Users/sshadley/uw/FullStack-Ground/01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/28-Stu_Local-Storage-Todos/Solved/index.html)

  * When we submit an item to our todo list, where does it go?

  * Our items are stored in the browser. So far none of the applications we've worked on have had any kind of persistent data. When an application was refreshed in the browser, all of its state was reset. 

 * How would we build this application?

  * We would need some kind of storage to hold our data and be able to manipulate that storage via JavaScript.

  * What would allow that?

 * A web API. Specifically client side storage.

### Instructor Do: Demo Local Storage (10 mins)

635-45

[20-Ins_Local-Storage-Counter]

* Increment/decrement coding hours

* Application > Local Storage > file

* Ask: Is this a database?

  * No, this is **client-side storage**. Data is stored in the client or browser, while a database would require a server.
  
* show `script.js`

* Ask: Does anyone see how we're getting the number of hours?
  
  * `localStorage.getItem()`

* Ask: Does anyone see how we're updating the number of hours?
  
  * `localStorage.setItem()`

* Note: `localStorage` only allows storing strings. Storing an `object` will not work

### Student Do: Local Storage (8 mins)

645-53

Try out local storage yourself

Fill in code to save email and password to local storage

[21-Stu_Local-Storage-User/Unsolved]

### Instructor Do: Review Local Storage (3 mins)

653-56

Live code and show in chrome (3 lines)

[21-Stu_Local-Storage-User/Solved/script.js]

Note: There are `float`s used in lots of these activities. I didn't fix today's sets because it's not the CSS that is interesting - it's the JavaScript.

I talked to a principal software engineer about the course and mentioned that floats were being used and he couldn't believe it.

### Student Do: Local Storage With Objects (15 mins)

656-711

Remember how I said localStorage can only store strings? This activity is about finding a way to store an object as a string.

Hint/Reminder - if you are googling you aren't cheating. You are utilizing one of the most powerful tools that a developer has.

[23-Stu_Local-Storage-Objects/Unsolved/script.js]

### Instructor Do: Review Local Storage With Objects (5 mins)

711-16

[23-Stu_Local-Storage-Objects/Solved/script.js]

 * `JSON.stringify`

 * `JSON.parse(<object>)`

 * JSON: JavaScript Object Notation - a text representation of a JavaScript object

 * Useful for serialization as well

### Instructor Do: Demo Data-Attributes (5 mins)

We can also store data inside HTML elements using data-* attributes. Show gif example.

716-21

[24-Ins_Data-Attributes/index.html]

* select the image container

* on click we update the `data-state`

### Instructor Do: Review All TODOs (20 mins)

721-41

We're jumping all the way to activity 28. The intermediate activities build up to this. Outside of class see if you can try solving each activity that builds up to this.

[28-Stu_Local-Storage-Todos/Solved/script.js]

* Show the TODO app

  * Add notes, refresh, show local storage, delete notes

* Reads from an array to populate TODOs

* on `submit` we add to that array

* when clicked we need to what TODO was clicked to be able to remove it so we use a `data-index` attribute to keep track of each one

* on `click` we do event delegation to check if it's a `button` then we remove from the list with `splice(start_index, delete_count)`

* we have to remember to re-render our TODOs to reflect the new state

* to persist this we use `localStorage`

* we want to store a non-string so we first have `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`

### BREAK (15 mins)

741-56

### Students Do: Timer App (70 mins)

756-904

[29-Stu_Timer-App/Unsolved]

Use the timer app to show the remaining amount of time

### Instructor Do: Review Timer App (15 mins)

904-19

[29-Stu_Timer-App/Solved]

  * We create a function called `startTimer`. We will use it to call our `setTime` function.
  
  * We create a `setInterval` function and store it inside a variable called interval.

  * Ask the class, "Why do we store our setInterval into a variable?"

  * So we can clear it later.

  * We create a function call `pauseTimer` which will clear our interval and call our `renderTime` function.

  * We create a function called `stopTimer`. When this function is invoked we set our secondsElapsed to `0`, and call our `setTime` and `renderTime` functions.

  * We create a `setTimePreferences` function. We use `localStorage.setItem`, naming the key `preferences` and stringifying our work minutes and rest minutes so they can be added into localstorage.

  * We create a `getTimePreferences` function. Next we `JSON.Parse` the getting of our `preferences` localstorage item to turn our stringified object back into an object

* If preferences exists in localstorage and has a key/value pair of `workMinutes` we set our `workMinutesInput.value` to be equal to our preference objects `workMinutes` value.
  
  * If preferences instead has no `workMinutes` but has `restMinutes` then we set our `restMinutesInput.value` to be equal to our preference objects `restMinutes` value.
