# 4.2 Lesson Plan - Events Extravaganza (6:30 PM)

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Students (5 min)

6:30-35

* Today we'll be learning about how to handle user actions

* First a few points

    * I know the course can be frustrating. Remember in the first day when I said learning can feel a lot like frustration? Anyone remember how to check if you were actually learning?

    * Think about where you are right now. How much have you learned since just a few weeks ago when we started? Many of you didn't know how to create a directory, file or use the terminal.

    * Now you can create a web app.

    * VS Code, command line, git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (3 languages), Bootstrap, GitHub, deploying websites to GitHub Pages, responsive, handle user input, flexbox, arrays, functions, objects, control flow with if/else, logging

    * That's a lot. It hasn't even been a month of classes. Stop and celebrate that. You've grown a lot and are capable of programming something so much more powerful than you were just a month ago.

    * Remember that this course does take a lot of work to keep doing such rapid growth. We recommend 20-30 hours per week _in addition_ to class. Go through the activities, do the homework, get into study groups, remember to pseudocode.

    * Any questions before we start?

### 2. Instructor Do: Pseudocode Modal Demo (10 min)

6:35-45

friend list you can add/edit

[fs-ground-04-web-APIs-event-demo](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/fs-ground-04-web-APIs-event-demo/)

* pseudocode

* How do we enable someone to add another user?
  * input for `name`

* When a user clicks `Add Person` what happens next?
  * get data from `name`
  * store that person somewhere
  * create a new list item
  * add an `edit` button inside the list item
  * add the list item to the main list

* What happens when `edit` is clicked?
  * Need to show a modal dialog
  * Contents of modal shows details for the person we clicked

* What happens when we click `save`?
  * The modal dialog needs to disappear
  * We need to keep track of that description and who it belongs to

* We're going to build up to this towards the end of class

### 3.  Instructor Do: On Click Demo  (5 min)

6:45-50

toggle dark/light mode

[10-Ins_Onclick/index.html](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/04-web-apis/2-tuesday-js-events/activities/10-Ins_Onclick/index.html)

  * We get each element at the top
  * We call the `addEventListener` on our toggle button
    * This requires two parameters
    * our new event and a function to run when the event occurs
      * this is called a callback function
      * what would happen if we included parenthesis?

### 4.  Students Do: addEventListener (15 min)

6:50-7:05

increment/decrement counter

[11-Stu_Onclick/Unsolved](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/11-Stu_Onclick/Unsolved)

### 5. Instructor Do: Review addEventListener (5 min)

7:05-10

[11-Stu_Onclick/Solved/index.html](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/11-Stu_Onclick/Solved/index.html)

  * Clicking increment/decrement updates the counter differently for each button
  
  * The second argument of `addEventListener` is an anonymous callback function. This function will execute the body of the callback each time the event is triggered.

### 6. Instructor Do: Demo event.preventDefault (10 min)

7:10-20

* Forms have default behaviors that occur on submission.

* What happens if you refresh a page that has form data?

[12-Ins_Preventing_Default_Events/index.js](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/12-Ins_Preventing_Default_Events/index.html)

  * Enter values into the input fields and click on the submit button.

  * Demonstrate that the entire click object appears in the console.

  * Show the code

### 7. Student Do: Tip Calculator (15 min)

7:20-35

tip calculator

[13-Stu_Preventing_Default_Events/Unsolved](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/13-Stu_Preventing_Default_Events/Unsolved)

### 8. Instructor Do: Review Tip Calculator (5 min)

7:35-40

[13-Stu_Preventing_Default_Events/Solved/index.html](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/13-Stu_Preventing_Default_Events/Solved/index.html)

* pseudocode first

  * when I click calculate tip
    * total * percent
    * nearest cent
    * show tip amount and total
  * when I click split
    * divide total by number of people
    * update the page

* HTML

  * `type=number`
  * `min=0`

* JavaScript

  * `preventDefault`
  * No functions are actually executed until the bottom of the file
  * `toFixed(n)` round to nearest cent
  * Even though `total` and `tipPercentage` are strings, we can still multiply them. This is because in JavaScript, the `*` operator coerces both arguments from strings into numbers before multiplying them. This is also the case for all arithmetic operators *except* for addition.
  * Since both `total` and `tipAmount` are strings, we need to convert them into numbers before adding them. Remind students that the `+` operator concatenates strings.
  * The bonus can be achieved by taking the text content of the `total` element and dividing it by the value from a field that describes how many people to split the bill between.

### 9. Instructor Do: Demo Key Events (5 min)

7:40-45

[14-Ins_Other_Events/index.html](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/14-Ins_Other_Events/index.html)

### 10. Student Do: Listening For Other Events (15 min)

7:45-8

[15-Stu_Other_Events/Unsolved](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/15-Stu_Other_Events/Unsolved)

### 11. Instructor Do: Review Other Events (5 min)

8-05

[15-Stu_Other_Events/Solved/index.html](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/15-Stu_Other_Events/Solved/index.html)

* Ask: Why does clicking on a blank spot on the page add the entire page to `target`?

### 12. Everyone Do: BREAK (15 min)

805-20

### 13. Instructor Do: Demo Event Bubbling and Propagation (10 min)

820-30

[16-Ins_Event_Bubbling/index.html](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/16-Ins_Event_Bubbling/index.html)

* We have a click event listener on each div

* What will happen when we click the innermost div?

* What about the middle one?

* Why?

* discuss `event.stopPropagation`

* whiteboard the DOM tree

* show the event bubble up

### 14. Student Do: Event Bubbling (20 min)

830-50

[17-Stu_Event_Bubbling/Unsolved](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/17-Stu_Event_Bubbling/Unsolved)

### 15. Instructor Do: Review Event Bubbling (5 min)

850-55

[17-Stu_Event_Bubbling/Solved/index.html](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/17-Stu_Event_Bubbling/Solved/index.html)

### 16. Instructor Do: Event Delegation Demo (10 min)

855-905

[18-Ins_Event_Delegation/index.html](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/18-Ins_Event_Delegation/index.html)

* Show `index.html` but do not open `script.js` yet.

* open the browser and add a couple of items to the shopping cart.

  * Ask the students what JavaScript code they think is necessary for this behavior. Specifically, ask them where they would set up the event listeners.

  * Students may suggest that the event listener is added to each button. 

* Open `script.js` and direct students to the `addEventListener` line. 

  * Note that the event listener was added to the entire list. Then, within the callback, we determine whether or not the clicked item was a button or not by using `event.target.nodeName`. This technique is known as **event delegation**. 

  * Be sure to mention that event delegation is the technique of listening for events on a parent element, then **delegating** those events differently, depending on the target.

### 17. Student Do: Event Delegation (20 min)

905-25

This is what we've been building up to and is the last activity

Create the friends list app showed at the beginning

[19-Stu_Event_Delegation/Unsolved](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/19-Stu_Event_Delegation/Unsolved)

### 18. Instructor Do: Review Event Delegation (5 min)

925-30

pseudocode

* clicking edit shows a dialog

  * clicking save stores a description associated with that person being edited
  * closing the dialog with "X" discards that info
  * clicking "X" stops displaying the dialog

* Clicking "Add Person" creates a new list item to add to the end of the friend list
  * has a default description of empty string
  * we display all the previous people plus the newly added friend

* none of the above should clear anything

* draw DOM

[19-Stu_Event_Delegation/Solved/index.html](../../../UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C/19-Stu_Event_Delegation/Solved/index.html)

  * In `handleClick`, we check to see if the element clicked is a `button`. This is sufficient because this is the only button element on the page at this time.

  * Then we set up variables for the name and description of the person that we clicked on.

  * The `textContent` of the modal header is set to the name and the value of the description textarea is set to any existing description. The logical OR operator ensures that the description is set to an empty string if the value in our array is undefined.

  * Remind students that `save` isn't actually persisting the data in a database. We are simply updating the description property of the current person in our people array. This data will remain until we close the browser or reload the page.

  * To setup the behavior to close when the modal is clicked away from, we add an event listener to the document object. We use event delegation to check if the element clicked is the modal container. If so, we close the modal.
