# Custom Methods

## Instructions

* Open `userModer.js` and create the following custom methods.

  * `setFullName`: sets the current user's `fullName` property to their lastName appended to their `firstName`

  * `lastUpdatedDate`: sets the current user's `lastUpdated` property to `Date.now()`

* When you are finished use your new custom methods in a `POST` request.
