# 5.3 Lesson Plan - jQuery Calculator

### Instructor Do: Motivation + Pulse Check

6:30-40 (10 min)

many students will feel defeated by JavaScript - give a pep talk

first half will be to build activities to gain experience with JavaScript scope

Second half is to build a calculator using jQuery

### Partners Do: 17-ScopeQuiz

640-47 (7 min)

lexical scope is also called static scope

designed to show that you cannot instantiate multiple instances of the same variable

two example blocks of code - one right, one wrong (fix the wrong one)

### Instructor Do: Review 17-ScopeQuiz

647-52 (5 min)

`myvar2` is redeclared inside the second block

this creates a second "local instance" with a smaller scope

### Partners Do: 18-ThisExample

652-702 (10 min)

manipulates `this` in different ways and asks to guess the otuput

### Instructor Do: Review 18-ThisExample

702-12 (10 min)

low priority

avoid bonuses unless students are doing well

`this` is a reference to the object it is inside of

### Students Do: 19-Cobweb

712-22 (10 min)

low priority

navigates deeply nested objects to print

### Instructor Do: Review 19-Cobweb

722-32 (10 min)

see if students want to come up and type themselves

don't go over the bonus

### Instructor Do: 20-jQueryCalculator

732-42 (10 min)

demo the calculator

normal inputs

multiple operators

no operators

activity broken into four phases (I'll instruct when you should move on to the next phase)

try mixing up your groups - work with people you haven't worked with before

pair programming
explain driver / navigator
rotate every so often
bug check, tell what to type

1-1s if needed (crash-courses)
can directly ask students if they want more time outside class or make an announcement

this is the last activity

### Everyone Do: Phase 1: Getting Situated + Pseudocoding Stage

742-802 (20 min)

pseudocode

### Everyone Do: Phase 2: Begin Logic

802-32 (30 min)

### Break

802-17 (15 min)

### Everyone Do: Continue Logic Building

817-47 (30 min)

### Everyone Do: Refinement (25 mins)

847-912 (25 min)

### Instructor Do: Review Calculator (10 mins)

- Because this application is pretty massive, the main focus during review is to help students understand **how** they should be re-examining the code on their own. Starting with the code blocks collapsed may help with clarity (as in the below image with the `.on` methods).

- Give students the high points. Emphasize the following:

  - We set a number of variables in the `initializeCalculator` function.

  - We used jQuery to create separate on click listeners for numbers, operators, and equals.

  - We used `this.value` in the callback function to determine what the value was for a given number or operator.

  - We created code that would change the HTML content using `.html`

  - We took numeric inputs for `firstNumber` **until** a user clicks an operator. Once a user clicks an operator, we changed the value of a boolean, called `isOperatorChosen`, and immediately began recording the `secondNumber`.

  - Once a user clicks the "equal" button, we used conditionals to check which operation they had clicked, then ran that operation on the two numbers.

- Encourage students to spend some time re-examining this code. Even if they don't yet feel comfortable creating it from scratch, let them know that it has a number of key code snippets that they may find useful at various points in the class.
