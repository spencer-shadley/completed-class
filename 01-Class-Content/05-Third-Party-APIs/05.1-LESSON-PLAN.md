# 5.1 Lesson Plan - jQuery Begins (10AM)

## Class Instruction

### Instructor Do: DOM Manipulation

1001-06 (5 min)

demo previous not taking application

### Instructor Demo: DOM Manipulation with Plain JS

1006-16 (10 min)

basic example of creating and appending elements with plain JS

* live code `5.html`

### Students Do: 02-JSDrinkList (0:15)

1016-31

Loop to generate elements with HTML based on array

### Instructor Do: Review 02-JSDrinkList

1031-38 (7 min)

### Instructor Do: Introduce jQuery

1038-48 (10 min)

Back to powerpoint

### Instructor Do: 03-jQueryGenerators

DOM Manipulation with jQuery

1048-11 (12 min)

* Now return to the example completed before. But this time, use jQuery (`03-jQueryGenerators`).

* As with the last case, this one is divided into separate files to make it easier to explain in pieces.

  * `1.html` shows how we add in the jQuery library script at the top and that we use the $ selector to grab the div of interest. It also shows that we can change the HTML and append in just two lines. Be sure to point out how much simpler this is then the plain javascript version.

  * `2.html` points out that we could also create separate divs on the fly.

  * `3.html` points out that we can change the HTML class as well.

### BREAK

11-1140 (40 min)

### Students Do: 04-jQueryDrinkList

1140-55 (15 min)

Generating HTML with jQuery

* Proceed with the drinkList exercise. This time students will re-complete it using jQuery.

### Instructor Do: Review 04-jQueryDrinkList

1155-12 (5 min)

* Review the previous exercise. In your review point out each of the following

  * We used jQuery to grab the `drink-options` div.

  * We then created a new div and added content about the drinks (in a single line)

  * We then looped through and used the `append` to add the content to the page.

### Instructor Do: 05-OnClickBasic

12-1207 (7 min)

* Open the file `onclick.html` in `05-OnClickBasic`. Then walk students through the syntax for `on-click` events. Specifically, point out how:

  * The code has a jQuery selector to select the html element (button, header, anything)

  * It then has a `.on('click', function(){})` syntax for capturing the event.

  * Inside that event's function is the code that results from the click.

* Students will likely be confused by the syntax. Let them know to use it for now -- and that it will make more sense over time as we learn other concepts.

### Partners Do: 06-SandwichClick

1207-27 (20 min)

If we are good on time can extend

### Instructor Do: Review 06-SandwichClick

1227-32 (5 min)

* Review the activity. Be sure to talk about:

  * The use of counter variables at the top.

  * The on-click events tied to each of the sandwich headers. The on-click events trigger the counter to go up and creates the alerts.

  * In discussing the bonus, point out how images can be added. Note that we are injecting HTML with the src pointing to the jpg.

* Slack out the solution and the [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BLReDBUZRk) when done.

### Partners Do: 07-TriggerRandom

1232-44 (12 min)

### Instructor Do: Review 07-TriggerRandom

1244-49 (5 min)

* Review the activity. Be sure to point out that:

  * We latched onto the `random-button` using its ID. Let them know where to focus their attention: Not the classes, and not the spans. The ID is what mattered in this case.

  * We then created a click event tied to this `random-button`. This event triggers a random number between 1 and 1000 to be generated and printed to the HTML.

### Partners Do: 08-LotteryGenerator

1249-109 (20 min)

* Open the file `lottery-generator-solved.html` in the browser. Show students how the final result of their work will look.

### Instructor Do: Review 08-LotteryGenerator

109-14 (5 min)

* Review the activity. Be sure to discuss that:

  * We needed to create a for loop that created 9 different numbers. Without this for loop, we couldn't guarantee that we'd have 9 numbers. Also point out that we are using `prepend` as opposed to `append` so that the newest number shows up at the top.

  * The end result of the lottery looks like the below.

* Slack out the solution and [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh4wxhzePIs) when done.

### TAs Do: Intro HW

114-19 (5 min)

* Have TAs introduce the next homework assignment. This may just involve showing the homework videos and talking over them.

### EXTRA: 09-NumberChecker

119-39 (20 min)

### Switchboard

139-2

### Structured Review

2-?
