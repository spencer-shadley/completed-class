# 5.1 Lesson Plan - jQuery Begins (10AM)

## Class Instruction

### 1.  Instructor Do: Admin Items (0:05)

### 2.  Instructor Do: Today's Class (0:01)

### 3.  Instructor Do: DOM Manipulation (0:05)

### 4.  Instructor Demo: DOM Manipulation with Plain JS (0:10)

* This example is broken down into parts. Reveal each file one by one.

  * `1.html` is intended to simply show the empty div `empty-div` that we've created. This div will be used to hold our dynamic content.

  * `2.html` is intended to show that we can "select" this div using `document.getElementById`. We can then populate the div using the `innerHTML` property. At this point, opening the file in the browser will showcase the text being displayed.

  * `3.html` is intended to show that adding another line of `innerHTML` will replace the earlier text.

  * `4.html` shows that this replacement can be corrected if we create a new div dynamically and use the `appendChild` method to display it as well.

  * `5.html` shows that we can use the `setAttribute` method to change the CSS style

* Go over any questions from the previous example, then slack out the file `5.html`.

### 5.Students Do: Generating HTML with Plain JS (0:15)

### 6.  Instructor Do: Review Activity (0:07)

* Review the activity. In discussing the solution, point out how:

  * We utilized the `getElementByID` method to grab the div we'll be placing content into. We then store this element into a variable.

  * We then use a for-loop to loop through the drink list.

  * Inside the for-loop we continually create divs and change the `innerHTML` of each div to match the contents of each drink in the array.

  * Finally, we used the `appendChild` method to add the new divs we created to the original one.

* Slack out the solution and the [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_9-NeU2L_U) when complete

### 7. Instructor Do: Introduce jQuery (0:10)

### 8.  Instructor Do: DOM Manipulation with jQuery (0:12)

* Now return to the example completed before. But this time, use jQuery (`03-jQueryGenerators`).

* As with the last case, this one is divided into separate files to make it easier to explain in pieces.

  * `1.html` shows how we add in the jQuery library script at the top and that we use the $ selector to grab the div of interest. It also shows that we can change the HTML and append in just two lines. Be sure to point out how much simpler this is then the plain javascript version.

  * `2.html` points out that we could also create separate divs on the fly.

  * `3.html` points out that we can change the HTML class as well.

### 9. BREAK (0:40)

### 10. Students Do: Generating HTML with jQuery (0:15)

* Proceed with the drinkList exercise. This time students will re-complete it using jQuery.

### 11. Instructor Do: Review Activity (0:05)

* Review the previous exercise. In your review point out each of the following

  * We used jQuery to grab the `drink-options` div.

  * We then created a new div and added content about the drinks (in a single line)

  * We then looped through and used the `append` to add the content to the page.

### 12. Instructor Do: On Click Basic (0:07)

* Open the file `onclick.html` in `05-OnClickBasic`. Then walk students through the syntax for `on-click` events. Specifically, point out how:

  * The code has a jQuery selector to select the html element (button, header, anything)

  * It then has a `.on('click', function(){})` syntax for capturing the event.

  * Inside that event's function is the code that results from the click.

* Students will likely be confused by the syntax. Let them know to use it for now -- and that it will make more sense over time as we learn other concepts.

### 13. Partners Do: Sandwich Clicking (0:20)

### 14. Instructor Do: Review Activity (0:05)

* Review the activity. Be sure to talk about:

  * The use of counter variables at the top.

  * The on-click events tied to each of the sandwich headers. The on-click events trigger the counter to go up and creates the alerts.

  * In discussing the bonus, point out how images can be added. Note that we are injecting HTML with the src pointing to the jpg.

* Slack out the solution and the [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BLReDBUZRk) when done.

### 15. Partners Do: Trigger Random (0:12)

### 16. Instructor Do: Review Activity (0:05)

* Review the activity. Be sure to point out that:

  * We latched onto the `random-button` using its ID. Let them know where to focus their attention: Not the classes, and not the spans. The ID is what mattered in this case.

  * We then created a click event tied to this `random-button`. This event triggers a random number between 1 and 1000 to be generated and printed to the HTML.

### 17. Partners Do: Lottery Generator (0:20)

* Open the file `lottery-generator-solved.html` in the browser. Show students how the final result of their work will look.

### 18. Instructor Do: Review Activity (0:05)

* Review the activity. Be sure to discuss that:

  * We needed to create a for loop that created 9 different numbers. Without this for loop, we couldn't guarantee that we'd have 9 numbers. Also point out that we are using `prepend` as opposed to `append` so that the newest number shows up at the top.

  * The end result of the lottery looks like the below.

* Slack out the solution and [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh4wxhzePIs) when done.

### 19.	TAs Do: Intro HW	(0:05)

* Have TAs introduce the next homework assignment. This may just involve showing the homework videos and talking over them.

### 20. END

### 21.	EXTRA: NumberChecker 	(0:20)
