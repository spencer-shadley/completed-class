### Partners Do: 07-TriggerRandom

1232-44 (12 min)

### Instructor Do: Review 07-TriggerRandom

1244-49 (5 min)

* Review the activity. Be sure to point out that:

  * We latched onto the `random-button` using its ID. Let them know where to focus their attention: Not the classes, and not the spans. The ID is what mattered in this case.

  * We then created a click event tied to this `random-button`. This event triggers a random number between 1 and 1000 to be generated and printed to the HTML.

### Partners Do: 08-LotteryGenerator

1249-109 (20 min)

* Open the file `lottery-generator-solved.html` in the browser. Show students how the final result of their work will look.

### Instructor Do: Review 08-LotteryGenerator

109-14 (5 min)

* Review the activity. Be sure to discuss that:

  * We needed to create a for loop that created 9 different numbers. Without this for loop, we couldn't guarantee that we'd have 9 numbers. Also point out that we are using `prepend` as opposed to `append` so that the newest number shows up at the top.

  * The end result of the lottery looks like the below.

* Slack out the solution and [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh4wxhzePIs) when done.
