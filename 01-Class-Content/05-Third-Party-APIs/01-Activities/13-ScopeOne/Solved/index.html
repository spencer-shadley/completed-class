      // Overall flow
      // - When the return value of `outside()` is assigned to `insideOut`, a closure is created.
      // - A closure is an object that contains both a returned function and the environment in which that function was created.
      // - The environment consists of any local variables that were available to that function when and where it was declared.
      // - When we call `insideOut()`, it returns the values stored in `x` and `y` even though those were declared outside `inside()`.
      // - [MDN docs on closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).

      function outside() {
        // the scope of x is outside()
        var x = 1;

        // the scope of inside() is outside(); the scope of y is inside()
        function inside(y) {
          console.log(x + y);
        }

        return inside;
      }

      // calling outside() returns inside(), which is assigned to insideOut
      var insideOut = outside();

      // the return value is 3
      insideOut(2);

      // x is local to inside(), we can't access it globally
      // but a closure is created when outside() returns
      // giving insideOut() access to x
      console.log("The value of 'x' outside 'outside()' is: " + x);
