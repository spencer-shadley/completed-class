## Instructor Notes

## Class Instruction

### Instructor Do: Welcome Students

630-35 (5 min)

635-40 (5 min)

just show the interactions

640-50 (10 min)

### Instructor Do: 10-CaptainPlanetGame (pseudocode)

650-55 (5 min)

### Students Do: 10-CaptainPlanetGame (new superpower)

655-715 (20 min)

Add a new superpower (on click of a new button do some new trick)

### Instructor Do: Review 10-CaptainPlanetGame (new superpower)

715-20

See if a student has working code they would be willing to share

Stretch example if not

### Instructor Do: jQuery Recap (slides)

720-30 (10 min)

back to the slides

### Students Do: 11-FridgeGame

730-805 (35 min)

demo adding letters to a fridge

### Break

805-20 (15 min)

### Instructor Do: Review 11-FridgeGame

820-30 (10 min)

array

for loop with data-attribute

onclick

### Instructor Do: 12-CrystalExample

830-31 (1 min)

mention we have another example which has more examples of events and data attributes

### Instructor Do: Intro Lexical Scope (slides)

831-41 (10 min)

back to the slides

heavy on theory, a bit more challenging

draw nested code on whiteboard

draw boxes to represent each of the code nesting on the whiteboard

### Students Do: 13-ScopeOne

841-51 (10 min)

accesses variables inside and outside of scope

### Instructor Do: Review 13-ScopeOne

851-56 (5 min)

key is closures

### Students Do: 14-ScopeTwo

856-906 (10 min)

### Instructor Do: Review 14-ScopeTwo

906-11 (5 min)

- We introduced the concept of `this` without explanation.

- The key takeaway here is that using the keyword `this` will only print content related to the object directly above it, **not** from the grandparent.

### Students Do: 15-ScopeThree

911-16 (5 min)

### Instructor Do: Review 15-ScopeThree

916-21 (5 min)

- Try to have students explain the solutions to the last activity back to you.

- If no student can, try to explain it yourself using the solution provided. It's okay if you stumble as you explain -- that shows students that this stuff isn't obvious, and that you can be a great developer, even if these nested functions confuse you.

- Remind students that these are not easy activities. The key is simply for them to become familiar with the fact that JavaScript's handling of parent and nested functions isn't always intuitive, and that errors can arise if you aren't careful.

- Make sure they realize that studying these examples **is not** overly necessary.

### Everyone Do: Brain Teaser

921-41 (20 min)

- If you have additional time available in class, proceed with this activity [16-ColorCorrector](../../../../01-Class-Content/05-third-party-apis/01-Activities/16-ColorCorrector).

- It's challenging, and will likely take over 40 minutes to complete. It is not necessary that students finish it. At best, they may be able to get _started_ in class, but will likely need to spend additional time at home if they are interested in completing it.
