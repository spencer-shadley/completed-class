# 5.2 Lesson Plan - jQuery Jubilee (6:30 PM)

## Overview

In this class, we will further students' understanding of DOM Manipulation using jQuery. Towards the end of class, we will also introduce them to the concept of lexical scope.

`Summary: Complete activities 10-15 in Unit 05`

## Instructor Notes

## Class Instruction

### Instructor Do: Welcome Students

630-35 (5 min)

### Demo 10-CaptainPlanetGame

635-40 (5 min)

just show the interactions

### Students Do: Pseudocode 10-CaptainPlanetGame

640-50 (10 min)

### 4. Instructor Do: 10-CaptainPlanetGame (pseudocode)

650-55 (5 min)

### 5. Students Do: 10-CaptainPlanetGame (new superpower)

655-715 (20 min)

Add a new superpower (on click of a new button do some new trick)

### 6. Instructor Do: Review 10-CaptainPlanetGame (new superpower)

715-20

See if a student has working code they would be willing to share

Stretch example if not

### 7. Instructor Do: jQuery Recap (10 min)

- Next, spend a few moments going through the jQuery recap slides. The most important thing to explain in discussing these slides is the fact that jQuery is "capturing" HTML elements using the `$()`, and that we are then applying various methods to that element (or a different one in response).

- Finally, point out that students shouldn't be expecting to memorize all of the jQuery library. Point out that coding is all about understanding a general concept, and then "looking up" the exact code when needed.

- Field any questions that remain before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Students Do: Fridge Game (35 min)

- Open the solution file `11-FridgeGame` in `11-FridgeGame/Solved`, and show students how the application works. In short, the application allows users to click on letters from a menu and have those letters appear on the fridge.

- Then, slack out the below folder and instructions.

- **Folder:**

  - `Unsolved` in `11-FridgeGame/Unsolved`

- **Instructions:**

  - Working in groups of 3, complete the code for the fridge activity such that:

    1. JavaScript dynamically generates buttons for each of the letters on the screen.

    2. Clicking any of the buttons leads the SAME letter to be displayed on the screen.

    3. Hitting the clear button erases all of the letters from the fridge.

  - Note: This is a challenging exercise. You may want one person to type, while the other two watch over to catch bugs and/or research necessary snippets.

### 9. Break (15 min)

### 10. Instructor Do: Review Fridge Game (10 min)

- Spend the time necessary to ensure that the majority of students have a conceptual understanding of how the Fridge Game's code works. In explaining the solution, point out the following:

  - The creation of an array that holds all of the letters;

  - The for loop used to take letters from the array, associate each with a data-attribute and text, and then append them onto the page. Students will be confused about the concepts of `.addClass`, `.attr`, and `.text`. Spend the time necessary to explain each.

  - The on-click event needed to capture button clicks. Be sure to point out how we use the data-attribute (via the `.attr` method) to know which letter was clicked. This is a **KEY POINT**.

- Slack out the solution and the [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC529k3KzmE) for the activity.

### 11. Instructor Do: Crystal Example (10 min)

- Next, open the files found in the folder `12-CrystalExample`. These files closely match the students' homework assignment.

- They are included in the day's lesson primarily so students can refer back to them while working on their homework assignment. Use your discretion as to how much extra help your students need to complete their homework. If you feel students need a lot of help, feel free to spend time in class going over these examples. Otherwise, simply explain to students that the code is available, and offer a very high level explanation of how they can use the code provided.

### 12. Instructor Do: Intro Lexical Scope (10 min)

- Proceed to the Lexical Scope slides. Warn students that this section is pretty heavy on theory.

- Proceed with basic definitions of scope, using analogies to boxes or other simple concepts when possible. Mention the concept of nested functions -- before moving to the first code dissection. (Students will be dissecting the code example shown in the slides).

### 13. Students Do: Lexical Scope 1 (10 min)

- File(s): `13-ScopeOne/Unsolved/index.html`

- Instructions

  - Open `Unsolved/index.html` in a browser and then open the console.

  - With your neighbor, compare the results in the console to the JavaScript in `index.html` and answer the questions in the comments.

  - **HINT**: Read the [MDN docs on closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

### 14. Instructor Do: Review Lexical Scope 1 (5 min)

- Open `13-ScopeOne/Unsolved/index.html` and ask students to answer the questions posed in the comments. The key concept to address is _closures_. Explain the following points:

  - When the return value of `outside()` is assigned to `insideOut`, a closure is created.

  - A closure is an object that contains both a returned function and the environment in which that function was created.

  - The environment consists of any local variables that were available to that function when and where it was declared.

  - When we call `insideOut()`, it returns the values stored in `x` and `y` even though those were declared outside `inside()`.

- If students have further questions, refer them to the [MDN docs on closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).

### 15. Students Do: Lexical Scope 2 (10 min)

- Proceed with the next activity.

- **File:**

  - `lexical-scope-2-unsolved.html` in `14-ScopeTwo`

- **Instructions:**

- Take a few moments to dissect the code just sent to you.

- Try to predict what will be printed in each of the examples.

- Be prepared to share!

- Note: Pay attention to the unusual use of the keyword: ‘this”

### 16. Instructor Do: Review Lexical Scope 2 (5 min)

- Proceed with the review. This example may have been more challenging to students, as we introduced the concept of `this` without explanation.

- The key takeaway here is that using the keyword `this` will only print content related to the object directly above it, **not** from the grandparent.

### 17. Students Do: Lexical Scope 3 (5 min)

- Proceed with the next activity.

- **Files:**

  - `lexical-scope-3-unsolved.html` in `15-ScopeThree/Unsolved`

- **Instructions:**

- Take a few moments to dissect the code just sent to you.

- Try to predict what will be printed in each of the examples.

- Be prepared to share!

- Note: Pay attention to the unusual use of the keyword: ‘this”

### 18. Instructor Do: Review Lexical Scope 3 (5 min)

- Try to have students explain the solutions to the last activity back to you.

- If no student can, try to explain it yourself using the solution provided. It's okay if you stumble as you explain -- that shows students that this stuff isn't obvious, and that you can be a great developer, even if these nested functions confuse you.

- Remind students that these are not easy activities. The key is simply for them to become familiar with the fact that JavaScript's handling of parent and nested functions isn't always intuitive, and that errors can arise if you aren't careful.

- Make sure they realize that studying these examples **is not** overly necessary.

### 19. Everyone Do: Brain Teaser (20 min)

- If you have additional time available in class, proceed with this activity [16-ColorCorrector](../../../../01-Class-Content/05-third-party-apis/01-Activities/16-ColorCorrector).

- It's challenging, and will likely take over 40 minutes to complete. It is not necessary that students finish it. At best, they may be able to get _started_ in class, but will likely need to spend additional time at home if they are interested in completing it.

- Play it by ear if you'd like to walk through the solution.
