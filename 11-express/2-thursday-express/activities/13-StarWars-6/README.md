# Star Wars 06

## File

- `server6.js`

## Instructions

- Look at the file sent to you then explain to the person next to you what the `res.sendFile` line does. Then try creating a new HTML file and routing to that one instead.

- Play around with `view.html` - test how it interacts with the server

- Try creating an `add.html` with a route that allows adding characters

## Hint

- If you get stuck, check out the `add.html` in `14-FinalStarwarsApp`
