# Selection Sort

## About

- As a first stab at this from a computational perspective, we could use the following approach:

- Scan through the list and find the smallest number possible. (This would require looping through and checking which number is greater than 0, but smaller than all other numbers)

- We would then say that this is our 1st number.

- We would then loop through and check which number is bigger than this smallest number, but smaller than any other number.

- This would then be our second number.

- And so on...
