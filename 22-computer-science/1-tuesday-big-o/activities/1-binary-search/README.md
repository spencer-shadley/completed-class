# Binary Search

- How could we more efficiently find an element in `example.md`? Could we augment it in some way to make the search easier? (think about this before reading the next steps)

- Research "binary search"

- Check out [this visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html) (add a search input and click "Binary Search")

- Try writing pseudo-code

- Look through implementations of it

## Bonus

- Read through `binarySearch.js` (do this only after you have written your own pseudo-code for binary search)
