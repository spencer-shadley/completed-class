# Binary Search

Pseudocode "Binary Search" to find a number in a given sorted array of numbers

## Resources

- [example.md](./example.md)

- Check out [this visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html) (add a search input and click "Binary Search")

## Bonus

- Implement binary search in [binarySearch.js](./unsolved/binarySearch.js)

- Can we use binary search on unsorted inputs? If so, how? What are the implications of these changes?
