# Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Instructions

- Implement the `search` function to enable finding a value in the BST

## Resources

- use [balanced-binary-search-tree.png](balanced-binary-search-tree.png) as a reference

- https://visualgo.net/en/bst

## Bonus

- Add an `insert` method to `Node` which inserts a new `Node` into the tree while maintaining a BST

  - Don't worry about it being balanced

- Implement the `search` function recursively and iteratively

- After class solve [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/)
