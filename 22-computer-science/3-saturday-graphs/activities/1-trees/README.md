# Trees

## Instructions

- Draw a binary tree (the code kind)

- Pseudocode how you might represent a tree in code

## Bonus

- Create a class which can represent a binary tree

  - Use that code to create a code representation of [this tree](./tree.png)

  - Traverse the tree to print the `5`

- Write code to support an n-ary tree (tree with any number of children)

  - Create [this tree](./n-ary-tree.png) using that code

  - Traverse the tree to print the `7`

- After class try some of [these problems](https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/)

## Hints

- To represent structures in programming languages we use classes

- Each node in a tree is another smaller tree

- The two main steps to this are representing a single node and figuring out how to connect nodes together to compose larger trees

- If you are stuck on the code there are many resources available online if you search for "binary tree JavaScript"

  - do not do this unless you are truly stuck
