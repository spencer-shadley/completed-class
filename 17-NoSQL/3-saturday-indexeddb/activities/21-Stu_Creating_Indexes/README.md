# Creating Indexes

In this activity, you will create an index on your object store that can be used to query data.

## Instructions

- Write code to request an IndexedDB database instance.
- On success, log the result to your console.
- Inside the `onupgradeneeded` method, create an object store for you database called `toDoList`. Next, create three indexes for your ToDoList called `backlog`, `inprogress` and `complete`.

## ðŸ’¡ Hint(s)

- Use the [createIndex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBObjectStore/createIndex) docs if you are stuck.

- You may need to delete your database or update the version and then refresh the database in Chrome to see the indices. This is because `onupgradeneeded` is only fired when the db is newly being created or the version has changed.
