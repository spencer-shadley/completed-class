## Global Changes
---

** Node Modules **

- Your repository should NOT include node_modules. This should be prevented using a .gitignore file in root folder of the repository.
- If your repository contains node_modules, here is a resource to remove them:
- [NodeModules](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50675829/remove-node-modules-from-git-in-vscode)


** Package.json **

- Your application is missing a package.json file. This is important because it lists the dependencies, dev-dependencies, and scripts required for the application.
- Remember to always create a package.json by running `npm init`. 
- With a package.json file, a person can clone your repository and just run npm i to load all necessary node modules. 
- Without, the person needs to look at each individual dependency and install it manually. (This results in a frustrated TA grading homework) 


** Console.log **

- The console log should be used to debug and test your code as you progress. 
- When you are ready to deploy/submit the assignment its best to either comment them out or delete them from your project. 


** Readme **

- Your Readme could be a more descriptive. It may not seem important in these simple early projects, but will grow in importance as the complexity of your project grows. 
- Instilling good habits early is key.
