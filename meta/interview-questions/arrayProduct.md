Given an array of numbers, return an array where each value is the product of all the other values in the array.

Example:
[1, 2, 3] => [6, 3, 2]

Example 2:
[0, 1, 2] => [2, 0, 0]

Example 3:
[0, 0, 1] => [0, 0, 0]

The key here is identifying that zeroes can have interesting effects. I try to let the candidate get that on their own but will give hints based on time.
