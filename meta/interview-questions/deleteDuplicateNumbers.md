# Question

Given an array of numbers, return a new array with only the unique numbers included

# Solution

## Fast but uses memory

- Make a Map of the characters seen

- Use the Map to make a new array with only the unique characters

## Slow but no memory (brute force)

- Loop through the array

- Nested loop to check for a duplicate value before adding
