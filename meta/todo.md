# TODO for the Remainder of the Course

- Miscellaneous

  - Add regular interview times
  - Figure out how to add more computer science

1. Unit 18 (PWA)

   1. ~~HW architecture~~
      - front-end is given
      - smaller app with simpler architecture than most (no clear MVC divide, for example)
      - mongo and mongoose as our data, express as our server
      - we need to model the data
        - `seed.js` gives away the schema
        - the model will only have one `workout` model
      - routes to handle different areas
        - click different areas in the front-end and check the network or use `morgan`
        - two different routes - `view.js` for our two views and `api.js` for our api calls
