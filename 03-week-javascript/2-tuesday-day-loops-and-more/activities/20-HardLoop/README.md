### File

* _None_

### Instructions

* Starting from scratch, write code that loops through the following array and logs the name of each animal on the farm to the console:

```javascript
var myFarm = ['chickens', 'pigs', 'cows', 'horses', 'ostriches'];
```

* Then check if the first letter in the animal's name begins with a "c" or "o". If it does, create an alert saying, "\<animal\> starts with 'c' or 'o'!"

* **HINT:** You can access the first character of a string as if it were the first element of an array.

### Bonus

* `console.log` "I just saw an animal like that!" when the current animal's name is the same number of characters as the previous animal's name
