## File

* [`zoo-loop-unsolved`](Unsolved/zoo-loop-unsolved.html)

### Instructions

* Use `for` loops to rewrite the file.

* If you need help, use the code from the previous example as a guide.

* Once you think your code is functioning properly, share it with the person sitting next to you.

### Bonus (hard)

* Ask the user if they would like to add more to the array

* If the user does - ask them what to add and include it in the array

* Ask again

* Do this until the user declines adding more to the array

* When the user declines, `console.log` the array
