# Express Calculator

## Instructions

- You will create an Express calculator application with one `GET` route that is able to take in three parameters: an operation and two numbers.

- There are four operation values which a user may use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- When the route is hit, your browser should display the result of the math operation.

- For example, when the user goes to the url http://localhost:3000/add/10/1, the page should display 11.

## Bonus

- Handle additional routes for these operations. For example, http://localhost:3000/+/10/1
