`05-SequelizeLibrary/Unsolved`

# Instructions

- Create a `'sequelize_library'` DB.
- Modify `'connection.js'` to include your MySQL user/database information.
- In the `'models'` folder, modify the `book.js` file to create a book model. Further details can be found inside this file.
  - Your book model must include a title, author, genre, page numbers.
- Modify `'api-routes.js'` using sequelize query methods to create the required routes.

# Hint

- This will require more advanced querying than we have shown so far to complete. Make sure to continue using your Google Fu!
