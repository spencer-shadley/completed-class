# Instructions

- Spend the next few ~15 minutes with your partner answering the following questions. You should be using the Sequelize Documentation (and whatever other references you find online).

  - Question: What is Sequelize?

  - Question: What advantages does it offer?

  - Question: How do I install it? How do I incorporate it into my app?

  - Question: What the heck is a Sequelize model? What role will it play?

  - Let's say I have the below table in MySQL.

    | Anime                           | Genre   | Release Year | Rating |
    | ------------------------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------ |
    | Enen no Shouboutai              | Action  | 2019         | 7.8    |
    | Made in Abyss                   | Mystery | 2017         | 8.8    |
    | Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood | Fantasy | 2010         | 9.2    |
    | Steins;Gate                     | Sci-Fi  | 2011         | 9.1    |

    - Question: How would I model it in Sequelize?

      ```js
      ```

    - Question: How would I query for all the records where the Release Year was less than 5 years ago?

      ```js
      ```

    - How would I query the table, order it by descending Release Years, and limit the results to just show 2 of the records. Skipping the first two? (i.e. Results: Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Steins;Gate)

      ```js
      ```

# Bonus: How do I use sequelize to make changes to an existing table with data in it?
