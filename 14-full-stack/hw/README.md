# Unit 14 HW

## Part 1: Reflection

Reflect on what you have achieved so far in this course and answer the following questions:

### The Journey so Far

1. What have you learned so far?
2. What have you accomplished?
3. Think back to the first week, how have you changed and grown since then?

### Path to Success

1. What are your goals for the remainder of the course?
2. What do you hope to accomplish before the course completes?
3. What do you hope to accomplish after the course completes?
4. What do you plan to do to ensure you accomplish these goals?
5. How do these plans and goals differ from the first half of the course?

## Part 2: Sequelize - Reverse Engineering Code

Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code.

In the `Develop` directory, there is starter code for a project. Begin inspecting the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, in a markdown file, write a tutorial explaining _every_ file and its purpose. If one file is dependant on other files, be sure to let the user know.

At the end of the tutorial, add instructions for how you could now add changes to this project.

Following the [common templates for user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Common_templates), we can frame this challenge as follows:

```
AS A developer

I WANT a walk-through of the codebase

SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project
```

## Business Context

When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.

## Minimum Requirements

- A link to a document or video with instructions on how what each section of code is doing in `Develop/`.

## Bonus

- Get a head-start on project 2! Work with your [group](../../15-project-2-part-1/groups.md) on your:
  - Overall idea and theme for the project
  - MVP
  - Desired features
  - More information [here](../../15-project-2-part-1/hw/README.md)

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

- A few paragraphs detailing your reflection of the course. This can be submitted as either a `reflection.md` file in your GitHub repo or, if you would prefer your answers remain private, a comment on the assignment in BCS.

- A link to your `README` on GitHub and other resources describing the given code
