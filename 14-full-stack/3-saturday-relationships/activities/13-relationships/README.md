# Instructions

With a partner:

- How can we restructure our database tables if we wanted the ability to form a relationship between a Post and an Author?

- What would we have to change with these tables to make that possible?

  - Which table would have a foreign key and why?
  - What would that look like?

- Remember, an Author can and will have multiple Posts, but a Post will only have a single Author.

- Assume we won't be making a third table.
