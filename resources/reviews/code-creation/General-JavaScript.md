## Questions

1. Equals

   ```js
   var nick = 30;
   var besteman = 29;

   var sameAge;
   ```

   ❓ Write code that evaluates whether Nick and besteman are the same age. Using an if statement, assign the variable `sameAge` to true if they are the same age, and if they are not assign it to false.

1. For Loop

   ```js
   var numbers = [];
   ```

   ❓ Using a for loop, populate the array numbers with numbers 1 through 100 but only numbers that are divisible by 2.  This includes 100 as well.
   For Example,

   If I asked for 1 through 10 but only numbers that are divisible by 2. It will be

   numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

1. Object

   ❓ Using this info, make an object called movie.
   Write the values in the same order as the list.
   Copy and paste the list of actors to avoid spelling mistakes.
   Use title, wonAward, rated, actors, and rating as the named for their values.

   The movie John Wick info is

   - title - John Wick
   - wonAward - true
   - rated - R
   - actors -  Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe
   - rating- 85

1. Number Only

   ```js
   var customerCount = [30, 42, 122, true, 12, 34, 'rick'];
   ```

   ❓ We are tasked with ensuring that array called customerCount holds only numbers ie no strings or booleans. To that end, we must write code that will check the array elements to see if there is any other value other than a number.
   If there is an element that is not a number, remove it from the array.
   You can not simply rewrite customerCount with only numbers!!!!!

1. Grades

   ```js
   /*
    * Complete the function below.
    */
   function passOrFail(gradesArray) {}
   ```

   ❓ You're given an array that holds all grades for the students in a class. Your task is to build a corresponding array for the class that holds true for each student if they passed (with a score greater than or equal to 80), or false if they failed (with a score less than 80). Return this new array at the end of the function.

   You do not need to call the function or write arrays of grades for it

   ```js
   var grades = [50, 80, 90, 30];

   // Your code should make a new array
   // passed = [false, true, true, false];
   ```
