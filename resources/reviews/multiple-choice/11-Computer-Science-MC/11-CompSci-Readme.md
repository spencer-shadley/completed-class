## Computer Science - Multiple Choice Readme


### 1 

1. Solving a problem:

    * An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem or perform a calculation
    * From Week 22 Day 1 part time lession plan section 3
    * Tags: algorithm, vocab


### 2 

1. A Search:

    * Starting with a list then sequentially checking every item in the list for a search term is also known as a linear search
    * From Week 22 Day 1 part time lessson plan section 5
    * Tags: linear-search, vocab


### 3 

1. Another Search:

    * Starting with a sorted list then repeatedly halving the list to the portion that could contain the search term is a binary search
    * From Week 22 Day 1 part time lesson plan section 11
    * Tags: binary-search, vocab


### 4 

1. Linear Search:

    * In a linear search, doubling the length of an input array being searched causes a doubling of the time required to complete the search
    * From Week 22 Day 1 part time lessson plan section 5
    * Tags: linear-search, vocab


### 5 

1. Sorting Example:

    * Repeatedly scanning through a list of numbers, finding the smallest number, and moving it into its position in an array is an example of a selection sort
    * From Week 22 Day 2 part time lesson plan section 4
    * Tags: selection-sort, vocab


### 6 

1. Another Sorting Example:

    * Looping over a list, comparing two numbers at a time, swapping them if the first is more than the second, repeating until current number is less than the next number, or until reaching the end of the list, is an example of an insertion sort
    * From Week 22 Day 2 part time lesson plan section 9
    * Tags: insertion-sort, vocab


### 7 

1. More Sorting:

    * A quick sort works with selecting a pivot, partitioning around the pivot, then repeating with each partition and new pivot until partitions with just one number remain
    * From Week 22 Day 2 part time lesson plan section 12
    * Tags: quick-sort, vocab


### 8 

1. Algorithm Efficiency:

    * Time complexity refers to the rate at which an algorithm slows as input grows, when talking about algorithm efficiency

    * Tags: time-complexity, vocab


### 9 

1. Big-O Notation:

    * An algorithm takes twice as long to run when input size is doubled. This is O(n) in Big-O notation.

    * Tags: big-o-notation, tech-knowledge


### 10 

1. Nested Loop Efficiency:

    * Efficiency for an algorithm with two nested for loops is O(n^2)
    * From Week 22 Day 3 part time lesson plan slideshow
    * Tags: big-o-notation, tech-knowledge


### 11 

1. Data Storage:

    * A data structure is a way of storing data so that it can be used efficiently by the computer or browser
    * From Week 22 Day 3 part time lesson plan slideshow
    * Tags: data-structure, vocab


### 12 

1. LIFO structure:

    * Stacks are sequenced orders of numbers that only allow access to the top element (LIFO)
    * From Week 22 Day 3 part time lesson plan slideshow
    * Tags: stacks, vocab


### 13 

1. FIFO structure:

    * Queues are sequenced orders of numbers that only allow access to the top element (FIFO)
    * From Week 22 Day 3 part time lesson plan slideshow
    * Tags: queues, vocab


### 14 

1. Joined Data:

    * Linked lists are data structures in which each element of the list is sequentially joined to the next element
    * From Week 22 Day 3 part time lesson plan slideshow
    * Tags: linked-lists, vocab


### 15 

1. Object-Array Hybrid:

    * Dictionaries are hybrid data structures that can be iterated over like arrays and have key-value pairs like objects
    * From Week 22 Day 3 part time lesson plan slideshow
    * Tags: dictionaries, vocab


### 16 

1. Parent-Child Structure:

    * Trees are non-sequential data structures made of parent-child relationships, with internal and external nodes having ancestors and descendents.
    * From Week 22 Day 3 part time lesson plan slideshow
    * Tags: trees, vocab


### 17 

1. Network Structure:

    * Graphs are abstract models of network structure made up of a set of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges.
