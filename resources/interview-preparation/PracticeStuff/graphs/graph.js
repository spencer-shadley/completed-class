// GRAPHS
// ------------------------------
// node (vertex)
// Edge (connect nodes)

// Great for all data that has a lot of connections / relationships
// A tree is actually a type of graph, but not all graphs are trees. A tree is a connected graph without cycles. 
// A graph is simply a collection of nodes with edges between (some of) them. 

// Types of Graphs
// -----------------------------

// Directed vs Undirected
// Weighted vs Unweighted
// Cyclic vs Acyclic

// -----------------------------

// Directed
// Has the option to be 1 directional 

// Undirected
// Both have a relationship

// -----------------------------

// Weighted
// Has preference 

// Unweighted
// No preference

// -----------------------------

// Cyclic
// Vertices connected like a circle
// Can return to start

// Graphs
