# Interview

Interviews are largely split between behavioral and technical questions. More details below.

## Behavioral

These are questions which draw on your experience. Sometimes these are referred to as "soft" questions.

They tend to begin with "tell me about a time...", "give me an example where...", etc.

In an interview, follow the [STAR format](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method) for these questions.

Prior to the interview, create a list of things you'd like to talk about that demonstrate different qualities of yourself you'd like to share. Write out this list, look at example STAR questions and see how each of your examples would relate to one of the questions. Make sure you are ready to discuss each of your examples in the STAR format.

### Company

There are often questions about the company. Make sure you know about the company prior to the interview. What do they do? What direction are they taking going forward? What are their values? How do you align with their values? How could you improve their product(s)?

Passion and prior research into the company often shows in the interview and can be a red flag if the candidate is not familiar with or has not used their product.

## Technical

The core of the interview process is your technical interview.

These questions will primarily be from algorithms and data structures. To prepare, study these topics and practice problems.

### Order of Importance / Study Guide

It can be daunting to go through all of the above material. There are many data structures and algorithms, taking all of them on at once would be way too much. I recommend picking a data structure and mastering it. Then master algorithms associated with that data structure. Once you are confident (use the practice problems as a litmus test) move on to the next one.

[This mind map](https://coggle.it/diagram/W5E5tqYlrXvFJPsq/t/master-the-interview-click-here-for-course-link) helps to break down the ordering visually.

Below is my recommended order as well as a \[1-10\] rating on how important each is to perform well in an interview:
