# Resources for the class

* [GitLab](https://uwa.bootcampcontent.com/UWA-Bootcamp/UW-SEA-FSF-PT-11-2019-U-C) - where you are right now! This holds pretty much all of the class resources: activities, HW, slidedecks, etc.

* [BootcampSpot](https://bootcampspot.com/) - the admin stuff. Submit homework, take attendance, see course calendar, etc.

* [Panopto](https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%2259769e26-feb7-4894-85f4-aaeb0003f9d9%22) - class recordings

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - you will `push` your assignments here. This is where your code lives.
